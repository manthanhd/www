<meta name="description" content="So today I learnt that Google Now can show you bus times. I think this is cool as a student using public transport. Although, you have to be at or near the bus stop to view its times. It can pick that up from a calendar entry/email/search as well. It would&#39;ve been  nice if I could search for a bus stop to view its times but as it turns out, you can&#39;t. So I guess this isn&#39;t convincing enough to make me uninstall my bus checker app but it&#39;s a start." />
