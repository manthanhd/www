  <h1>Preventing class redefinition errors in C++</h1>

  <p>I have just started learning C++ and have been getting a lot of these errors. I finally found a solution to this after spending some time on the internet.</p>

<p>Say for instance you have a class called “Animal” and g++ complains that this class is being redefined. Just add the following two lines at the very top of the Animal.h file:</p>

<p><code>#ifndef ANIMAL_H
#define ANIMAL_H</code></p>

<p>and add the following at the very bottom of the file:
<code>
#endif</code></p>

<p>So, if your class is called SomeClass, then it will be SOMECLASS_H instead of ANIMAL_H. You should have these in every header file. It prevents that header file from being redefined more than once.</p>
