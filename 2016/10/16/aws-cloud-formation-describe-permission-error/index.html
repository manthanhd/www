  <h1>AWS cloud formation describe* permission error</h1>

  <p>So you know sometimes, its difficult to work with AWS cloud formation scripts. On surface, errors are seemingly random and unrelated to the script. This is what happened today. I wrote an awesome parameterised cloud formation script. I was quite proud of it, mainly because most of my parameters were typed. This mean that the parameters like, ec2_security_groups had a type of <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">List&lt;AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup::Id&gt;</span>. This not only makes it easier to work with that cloud formation script from the AWS console, but also makes it very easy to work with from a CI/CD pipeline as if those parameters are invalid, the script will fail instantly, instead of waiting for resources to deploy.</p>

<p>However, while doing this, I completely missed the fact that in order for cloud formation to validate your input parameters, it needs to look them up first. What IAM policy permission does a resource lookup need? <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">describe</span>!</p>

<p>For once, my IAM role had tightly restricted permissions and because of this I had to go on to expand them slightly to allow for describe permissions.</p>

<p>I kept getting this error about the role not having the describe permission and I kept wondering why it needed that. Well now you know too!</p>
