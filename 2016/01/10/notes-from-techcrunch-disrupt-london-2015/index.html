<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Day two</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Fireside chat with CEO of Twilio</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jeff Lawson. Used to work at Amazon web services. Observed that communications is key when building a customer centric business. In those times, comms costed a lot and required a lot of hardware infrastructure. Set out to create Twilio to make software driven communications that can be setup in matter of minutes. Strongly believes that the ability to experiment stuff very quickly is key to innovation and hence has built a business that allows developers to do exactly that.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Chat with Hassle.com</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alex Depledge. Website to get house cleaners on demand. It is important to be naive when moving into a new industry. She was able to make such an impact in cleaning industry because she was naive. Lost a lot of money, down to £100 but kept pushing. She and her team coded all Christmas and launched the product in January and made more money in that month than all in last six months combined. Strongly believes in free market which allows movement of labour. Talks about gender equality. Started “Girls can code” movement and found that there are women in tech but they are just aren't recognised. Also, at the younger age, there is a serious lack of awareness about technology. For instance, girls didn't know what a UX developer was or what a full stack developer did in their day job.
Thinks that government legislation needs to be refactored. The laws that govern today's business have been created in old times, situation that is probably not relevant anymore. Worse thing than refactoring code is writing more and more code on top of old code.</p>
