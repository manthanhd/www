  <h1>Generating random passwords from linux command line</h1>

  <p>Managing production passwords isn’t a trivial task. I was trying to deploy a containerized app the other day that had a database deployed with it. During the deployment, I was trying to find an easy way to set a secure password. I didn’t want anyone to know the password because I wanted only the application to know it and no one else. Also, the container was setup in a way that the database cannot be accessed from the outside world.</p>

<p>So instead of hard-coding the password, after doing some research, I used the following command:<!--more--></p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true">&lt; /dev/urandom tr -dc _A-Z-a-z-0-9+= | head -c${1:-32};echo;</pre>
<p>This might look like some gibberish but it uses linux’s <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">/dev/urandom</span> to generate some randomness and extracts human readable characters like alphabets, numbers and common symbols like underscores, hyphens, pluses and equals.</p>

<p>Try it! it works!</p>

<p>Now, using clever bash interpolation syntax you can embed this password throughout your script in a secure way.</p>
