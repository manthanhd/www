It is like measurement scale for code efficiency. If you go in details, it can become complex. However, in this post, I\u2019ll explain how to get a rough idea of your code\u2019s efficiency.\n\nTo roughly calculate it, you need to know size of your problem which is \u2018n\u2019 in this case. Look through your code, and analyze the loops that you have. Basically, loops are the determining factor. If your code has 100 loops (not nested) then the efficiency is O(n). No matter what the number is, if your code has no nested loops, then the efficiency is still O(n). However, if you have one single nested loop, then efficiency is n2. Nested loops decrease efficiency of code. This is simply depicted by the fact that n2 is greater than n.\n\nTo write efficient code, it should be your goal to reduce number of nested loops. To do this, the best way is to reuse values that have been previously generated. My way to do this is by using connected methods. I will be discussing more about this in next posts. You can also exit loops when you have met your aim. In this case, while loop is preferred but if you have more than one condition, you should exit the loop when they are met just to save iterations.\n\nIf you wish to know more about the big O notation, read the [article written by Rob Bell](http:\/\/rob-bell.net\/2009\/06\/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation\/)\n\n\n","html":"<p>The big O notation explains how efficient the code is.

First of all, you need two textboxes, one for username and another for password. I\u2019ll call them usernameTextBox and passwordTextBox for this example. Drag down a button and call it loginButton. Now, in the OnClick event of loginButton, you need to check if the provided combination of username and password is correct or not. You can only do this if you have username and passwords stored somewhere. It is recommended to use a database to do this. Create a AccountDetails table in your database. The table should have username and password fields, both as text (VARCHAR for SQL). The way login is going to work is that you select records from AccountDetails table who have the provided username and password. This query should return one row if the combination matches. If not, then it should return nothing. Here\u2019s the query you need to pass:\n\n`string query = \"SELECT * FROM AccountDetails WHERE username='\"+usernameTextBox.Text + \"' AND pass='\" + passwordTextBox.Text + \"'\";<br><\/br>`Supply this query to the command object. This can be OleDbCommand or SqlCommand depending on your type of database. Invoke the ExecuteReader method of the command object and then check if the Read method of the DataReader object returns true. If it does then this means that the login is successful. If not, then login is invalid. Here\u2019s a sample code.\n\n```\nstring connectionString = \"...\";<br><\/br>\nOleDbConnection conn = new OleDbConnection(connectionString);<br><\/br>\nconn.Open();<br><\/br>\nstring queryString = \"SELECT * FROM AccountDetails WHERE username='\"+usernameTextBox.Text + \"' AND pass='\" + passwordTextBox.Text + \"'\";<br><\/br>\nOleDbCommand command = new OleDbCommand(queryString, conn);<br><\/br>\nOleDbDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();<br><\/br>\nif(reader.Read()){<br><\/br>\n\/\/Login is successful.<br><\/br>\n}else{<br><\/br>\n\/\/Login failed.<br><\/br>\n}<br><\/br>```\nThats it! Your ASP website should now have a wonderful login to allow geniune users. To extend its capabilities, store the username in a session and then in PageLoad event of rest of the pages which require login, check if the session contains something. If it is null, then the page should redirect to login page. Same if for log-out. In the PageLoad event of the login page, check if the session username contains something. If it does, then clear out the session and display some notification saying that the user has been logged out. Now, in your page, to which the user gets redirected after successful login, put a simple link to login.\n\nNow, initially when user lands on the login page, the session username will be empty. However, on typing correct username and password, this session gets filled with the username of the logged user and he\/she is redirected to some sort of dashboard page. When the user clicks on the log-out link, he\/she gets redirected to the login page which first checks if there is anything in the session. Since the user has previously logged in, there will be a username inside that session. Login page clears it out and displays a message saying that the user has been logged out.

It is awesome. This time, I\u2019ll get started straight away!\n\nFirst of all, before making a thread in java, you need a runnable. Runnable is basically like a piece of code that you want to execute as a separate thread. There are two ways to create a runnable. You can do it by making an anonymous class such as:\n\n`Runnable r = new Runnable(){`  \n```\n<br><\/br>\npublic void run(){<br><\/br>```\n  \n` \/\/Your code goes here...<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"><br><\/br><\/span>`  \n```\n }<br><\/br>\n}<br><\/br>```\nHowever, this is not a good practice. Hence, it is advised to create a separate class which implements the Runnable interface like:\n\n``  \n`public class MyNewRunnable implements Runnable{`  \n`<br><\/br>`  \n` MyNewRunnable(){`  \n`<br><\/br>`  \n` }`  \n`<br><\/br>`  \n` public void run(){`  \n` \/\/Your code here...`  \n` }`  \n`}`\n\n<div>`\u00a0`<\/div>``In this manner, you can pass any parameters for processing the information using the class constructor. For instance, if you are making a runnable for downloading files, you can pass url of the file through the class constructor. Now, once you have created your runnable, you need a thread in which you have to put the runnable. Then you run the thread, the run method of runnable gets executed. For runnable r, you can make a thread as follows:\n\n`Thread t = new Thread(r);<br><\/br>`  \n Then, you can start the thread by typing:\n\n`t.start();<br><\/br>`  \n I\u2019d say that threading would help make your program more responsive. This is solely because of the fact that all the heavy processor hungry tasks are carried out in a separate thread and the UI thread is kept clean.\n\nSee Also: [How do I do threading in C#?](http:\/\/codeninjutsu.blogspot.com\/2012\/01\/how-do-i-do-threading-in-c.html)\n\n\n","html":"<p>My favorite concept in any programming language is Threading.

Hence, it is advised to create a separate class which implements the Runnable interface like:<\/p>\n<p><code><\/code><br \/>\n<code>public class MyNewRunnable implements Runnable{<\/code><br \/>\n<code><br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\n<code> MyNewRunnable(){<\/code><br \/>\n<code><br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\n<code> }<\/code><br \/>\n<code><br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\n<code> public void run(){<\/code><br \/>\n<code> \/\/Your code here...<\/code><br \/>\n<code> }<\/code><br \/>\n<code>}<\/code><\/p>\n<div><code>\u00a0<\/code><\/div>\n<p><code><\/code>In this manner, you can pass any parameters for processing the information using the class constructor. For instance, if you are making a runnable for downloading files, you can pass url of the file through the class constructor. Now, once you have created your runnable, you need a thread in which you have to put the runnable. Then you run the thread, the run method of runnable gets executed. For runnable r, you can make a thread as follows:<\/p>\n<p><code>Thread t = new Thread(r);<br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\nThen, you can start the thread by typing:<\/p>\n<p><code>t.start();<br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\nI&#8217;d say that threading would help make your program more responsive. This is solely because of the fact that all the heavy processor hungry tasks are carried out in a separate thread and the UI thread is kept clean.<\/p>\n<p>See Also: <a href=\"http:\/\/codeninjutsu.blogspot.com\/2012\/01\/how-do-i-do-threading-in-c.html\">How do I do threading in C#?<\/a><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 20:55:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 23:25:21 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 20:55:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":48,"title":"Writing multi-threaded code in C#","slug":"how-do-i-do-threading-in-c","markdown":"\nThreading in C# is no big deal.

Your Runnable class should look similar to:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java\">public class Work implements Runnable{\r\n\r\n@Override\r\npublic void run() {\r\n\/\/do some work..\r\n}\r\n}\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Now, you can create a thread in multiple ways but the most appropriate way is to pass the runnable object in its constructor.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"lang:java\">Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Work());\r\nWork work = new Work();\r\nThread thread2 = new Thread(work);<\/pre>\n<pre class=\"lang:java\">thread1.start();\r\nthread2.start();\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Make sure that you say <code>thread1.start()<\/code> and not <code>thread1.run()<\/code>. <code>thread1.run()<\/code> simply calls the run method within the runnable while <code>thread1.start()<\/code> runs the run method in separate thread.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it! Now you know the basics of threading in Java!<\/p>\n<p>Check out the video tutorial here:<br \/>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/videoseries?list=PL4DD8CFBE563F29AC&amp;hl=en_US\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sun, 15 Apr 2012 19:38:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 23:24:06 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 15 Apr 2012 19:38:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":38,"title":"Using Timer in Java","slug":"how-to-use-timers-in-java","markdown":"\nWell, this post will be similar to the one about Threading. However, it is an important concept and thus needs to be covered. First of all, to time a certain task, you will have to make a Timer object. However, a timer object needs to have a TimerTask object. Now, TimerTask is an abstract class and has a run method which gets called on set frequency. So, for instance, if the frequency of the task has been set to 2000 ms, then the run method gets called every 2000 ms. To use Timers, you will have to create your own class which extends the TimerTask class. This would be something like:\n\n```\n\u00a0public class SomeTask extends TimerTask{<br><\/br>\n@Override<br><\/br>\npublic void run() {<br><\/br>\n\/\/Something to do here...<br><\/br>\n}<br><\/br>\n}```\n\nIf you are going to access UI elements of a particular JFrame from your SomeTask class, then you will have to pass a reference of that JFrame in its class constructor. This is because all your UI elements are private and thus cannot be accessed by an external class. You will also have to make methods which would access your private UI elements in the NewJFrame. For a JFrame called NewJFrame, the code would look like:\n\n`public class SomeTask extends TimerTask{`\n\nNewJFrame parent;  \n public SomeTask(NewJFrame frame){  \n parent = frame;  \n }\n\n@Override  \n public void run() {  \n \/\/Do work here  \n }  \n }\n\nIf you want to type Hello every five seconds to a JTextArea in NewJFrame, then you\u2019ll first have to create a method that would do that in your NewJFrame. This method can be as simple as:\n\n```\npublic void type(){<br><\/br>\njTextArea1.append(\"Hellon\");<br><\/br>\n}```\n\nNow, access this method from the run() method of your timer task simply by:\n\n`parent.type();`\n\nTo run this task, you will have to make a timer by:\n\n`Timer t = new Timer();`\n\nThen, create a new object of SomeTask class that you just created.\n\n`SomeTask st = new SomeTask(this);`\n\nNotice \u2018this\u2019 in the constructor. It is because we asked for it in the class constructor as the task needs to access the UI elements. Now schedule that task by:\n\n`t.schedule(st,0,2000);`\n\nThe above line takes three parameters. First is the TimerTask object, which in this case is the SomeTask object called st. Second is the intial delay (in ms) which is concerned with how long will it take to start the task for the first time and the third parameter is the frequency of the task which in this case is 2000 ms.\n\nThats it! Now you have scheduled your task and it will run almost instantly (0 ms delay). It will keep running every 2 seconds (2000 ms) until someone calls:\n\n`st.cancel();`\n\nWhich will stop the task from running.\n\nWatch the video tutorial here:\n\n<center><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-loYJQsE3TY\" width=\"480\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n","html":"<p>Well, this post will be similar to the one about Threading.

A YEAR AGO! I\u2019m actually amazed that I wrote such a thing. Well, so\u2026 Here it goes\u2026\n\nLinux, as you all know, is a free-open source operating system. Inspire of having number of advantages over Windows, Linux is still free and of course open source. Now, you might be thinking why I\u2019m using terms \u2018free\u2019 and \u2018open\u2019 source separately. \u2018Free\u2019 means that Linux is freely available and downloadable from internet. Some of the vendors like \u2018Ubuntu\u2019 offer CDs loaded with Linux absolutely free of cost. Open source means that if you know kernel programming and mechanics of operating system, then you can actually tweak Linux and also program Linux from a scratch. That\u2019s open source and Linux provides that flexibility. Unlike Linux, Windows is not open source. It does not allow user to modify its kernel or components. This is one of the reasons why Linux is hot favourite among young developers.\n\n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">What separates them?<\/span>**  \n The main difference between Linux and windows is their build. Practically, Windows is created only by Microsoft Corporation while Linux has been created and tweaked by entire world! Why entire world? Because, it\u2019s open source. If I have Linux and I find a bug, then I can tweak and remove that thing myself. I also tell the organization about the bug which I fixed. So, they verify it and tell their rest of the consumers about the fix. So, that\u2019s how it all works. With windows, it is not like that. I must appreciate Microsoft\u2019s efforts in improving windows because in new versions of windows \u2013 The Vista Series \u2013 they have put an improved version of error reporting like\u00a0Problems Report and Solutions. With that you can just submit the error report. You cannot tell them how to fix that even if you know. Of course, you cannot fix grave errors in windows even if you think because it\u2019s not open source!\n\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><\/div>[  \n](http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-mOMRW4ouf7Y\/T5pWKF5b9HI\/AAAAAAAAABs\/CHSczwEImQU\/s1600\/debian.png)  \n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Who\u2019s better on performance?<\/span>**  \n[![](http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-ofHO8h4jRIo\/T5pXXKotT0I\/AAAAAAAAAB8\/NoBlGPqy6zM\/s1600\/linuxdistros.jpg)](http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-ofHO8h4jRIo\/T5pXXKotT0I\/AAAAAAAAAB8\/NoBlGPqy6zM\/s1600\/linuxdistros.jpg)Practically, on considering stable releases of Linux offered by several organizations like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc., no doubt Linux outperforms Windows. Windows has always been a bulky operating system taking several minutes to boot up, then a minute to get stable and so on. While with Linux, running on an average PC, booting up is a child\u2019s play for Linux, 10 \u2013 15 seconds is a limit. Even if \u2018background processing\u2019 indicator on mouse cursor is on, you can still get your stuff by clicking. Exploring your computer is just with double-click of a button. You\u2019ll never find this speed on Windows!  \n Also, shutting down your PC is a matter of 5-6 seconds for Linux. And what\u2019s more? Linux works on a 1 GHz PC with 128 MB RAM and even 10 GB Hard Drive!\n\n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">What\u2019s your colour today?<\/span>**  \n Unlike Windows, Linux provides a lot of customization features. It is so flexible that you can customize almost everything. From changing your wallpaper to behaviour and animation of minimizing\/maximizing a window, you can change and tweak everything. Linux also provides various desktop effects \u2013 some of which even require a 3D card \u2013 which are super cool.  \n For Linux, wallpapers are billions, themes are millions, and yet there are thousands of programs that help even more to customize Linux. Also various types of desktop environment are available on Linux like GNOME (Most common with cool GUI), KDE (High end graphical interface), and Xfce (Fastest of all). These desktop environments not only handle the look and feel of the Linux environment but also provide you with lot of other flexibilities. Instead of trying out new desktop environments, I prefer to GNOME and its cool Compiz-Fusion Desktop effects which tweak almost all aspects of the operating system. In customization, Linux easily overcomes Windows.\n\n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Applications?<\/span>**  \n This is where Linux gets outperformed. Almost 91% of the applications available in the market run on windows. 5% work on Mac OS X, 3% of it in Linux and the rest are for other OS. Windows has its roots wide-spread all over the world because it was the first OS to offer the idea of multi-tasking and a lot more new features that were not even thought of at that time. While Linux \u2013 which is not that old but still is not as old as windows \u2013 has relatively very less number of applications available worldwide. Linux is rapidly getting wide spread in the world of computing because it is a lot more flexible and offers a lot more possibilities than Windows. Linux offers its developers great flexibility of working with applications. Previously, Linux was called non-user friendly because it was difficult to operate but now that it has been tweaked and is available in several forms, Linux has removed this badge of dishonour from itself.  \n Organizations like Ubuntu etc. have made Linux user friendly and easy to use operating system that provides its users with number of options which makes it easy to use.\n\n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Running Windows on Linux?<\/span>**  \n[![](http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-6VLcWKZuVcE\/T5pX_QdaB4I\/AAAAAAAAACE\/yPpkNoerhOQ\/s1600\/wine-windows.png)](http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-6VLcWKZuVcE\/T5pX_QdaB4I\/AAAAAAAAACE\/yPpkNoerhOQ\/s1600\/wine-windows.png)Also, now you can run Windows applications on Linux. With \u2018Wine\u2019 \u2013 an application for Linux \u2013 you can run windows applications and programs on Linux. Wine uses its DLL library to run Windows applications. If you dual boot Windows and Linux, then it\u2019ll be better. Wine uses Windows library and its own library in combination to run the application smoothly. Wine also has configuration screen where, you can select in which mode Wine should work. There are several modes available based on Windows OS Released. On my Linux, there are following modes:  \n \u2022 Windows Vista  \n \u2022\u00a0Windows XP  \n \u2022\u00a0Windows Me  \n \u2022 Windows 98  \n \u2022 Windows 3.0  \n And several others including server editions which I cannot recall right now.  \n Each of these modes create a separate environment for the application to run smoothly. Here, environment does not mean that your Linux look would change. You won\u2019t even notice that! So, are you thinking of running Windows Games on your Linux? Don\u2019t dream that! It won\u2019t run. Games are called as hefty softwares that require large amount of resources and also they have some of functions which are accessible to them in Windows but not in Linux. However, these people are trying a lot to make each and every application of Windows run on Linux. Good luck to them!\n\n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Where\u2019s the security?<\/span>**  \n Linux has security from viruses. Don\u2019t think that an antivirus system has been integrated to it. It isn\u2019t in this case. Because, Linux does not support viruses! Yes, Viruses don\u2019t run on Linux because they find it hard to harass you while you are logged in. Surprised? Ok, let\u2019s be frank. There\u2019s one virus on Linux and that\u2019s \u2013 Bliss. But just think of it. Linux has just one virus to support while Windows is entirely surrounded by viruses. Viruses for Windows \u2013 maybe billions \u2013 Viruses for Linux \u2013 Just One!! And that too is not going to do any big thing to your computer! So, here we have arrived to the point where we must say that Linux is too stout to respond to viruses. Consider a case where a burglar has entered a bank, he shows a gun, fires in the air and expects people to panic. But what happens? People ignore him! He shoots at the cashier but finds that his guns do not work against him. Bullets just fall down touching the cashier! This is the case when virus enters into Linux. Virus would try hard to do harm but Linux won\u2019t execute any operations that virus has told. Virus will try to infiltrate your files but that also would not work because unlike windows, Linux is not having applications chained.\n\n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Little things that matter!<\/span>**  \n Yet, there are a lot of little things offered by Linux that provide great advantage over Windows. First of all, Linux has a \u2018Force Quit\u2019 feature. If you find any misbehaving application (Though you\u2019ll rarely find) that\u2019s taking too long to respond, you can use Force Quit. Force quit is a utility provided in Linux which immediately exits a non-responding application. So, you won\u2019t need to wait minutes for a non-responding application to end. Sometimes, you\u2019ll find that in windows, when an application does not respond, then your computer will also not respond. This happens because in windows, all applications are chained. When running applications are chained, they all get affected if one of them stops responding. This is not the case in Linux, In Linux, applications work independently, meaning, that they are not chained. So, if any damn application gets \u2018hanged\u2019 your computer and other applications will continue working in full swing. Second advantage in Linux, that it has an in-built archive manager. With archive manager, you can handle multiple types of archives without installing a separate program for it. Linux also has a highly advanced calculator with three extended modes which are\u00a0\u2018Advanced\u2019, \u2018Financial\u2019\u00a0and\u00a0\u2018Programming\u2019. Linux also comes with Password and Encryption key manager which allows you to create passwords for applications and folders. It also allows you to create encryption keys whose strength ranges from 2048 bits to 4096 bits. With that, you can encrypt archives, files and folders to ensure that they are safe. Many Linux editions also allow you to change the way login screen looks and behaviour of the boot loader and its appearance. Linux also allows you to scale CPU usage. Meaning, you can set how much of the CPU power Linux should use. This helps you a lot in saving power. Suppose, you are reading an eBook on your Linux PC during a journey, if you were using windows, and even in power saver mode, you\u2019ll drain a lot of battery. But in Linux, it dims the display automatically. Now, reading an eBook does not require processing power. So, you can set the value to least mode. In this way, Linux will stop most of background processes which drain battery and will ensure that the battery is saved. Now, as were discussing about battery, it reminds me of an amazing feature that Linux provides. Linux has an in-built system that provides detailed information on the battery installed on your laptop. It includes details like your battery model, version, status, and vendor. These details are common in windows. Excluding these, it also tells you details about battery technology, serial number, current charge capacity of battery(in %), current charge(in watt-hour), last full charge(in watt-hour) and design charge(in watt-hour). It also provides you with information based on graphs too! I\u2019m sure that these features are not available on windows.  \n If you refer to new versions of windows, in Vista line, you\u2019ll find that they are having preview panes. The moment, you select an item, its preview (if available) is shown in the preview pane. Previews are available for pictures, music, videos and some other types. Suppose, I click a music file. If my computer or rather Windows media player has that plugin, then it will show a mini media player in the preview pane with a play button. If I click play button, it will search the plugin in Windows Media library and then it will play the file. On my VAIO BZ, windows music preview does not work correctly. For the first file I play on starting the computer, it takes a lot of time in loading the preview pane. After that it plays the file. Now, Ubuntu Linux 9.04 has something new to offer. Now, unlike windows, Ubuntu has a \u2018Movie Player\u2019 as default player. While exploring my computer, if I stumble upon a music file which I want to preview, I simply hover my mouse over it and immediately, it\u2019ll start playing the file. But unfortunately in this technique, pausing is not possible. If I move down my mouse from that music file, the file immediately stops playing. Ubuntu also does not offer a seek bar!  \n Also, there\u2019s one thing where Linux surrenders. It\u2019s Silverlight Experience! At Windows, you have Silverlight integrated in Windows Internet Explorer as well as many other web browsers like Firefox. But, in Ubuntu (or I assume in most of Linux operating systems) Silverlight isn\u2019t available. Yes, if you do visit a website featuring Silverlight, it\u2019ll tell you to download an alternative version of Silverlight as moonlight but even after downloading moon light, I can\u2019t get Silverlight experience \u2013 It still says that Silverlight is missing.  \n So, what do you learn from this? Most of all high-end Microsoft technologies aren\u2019t shared by Microsoft.  \n For all Photoshop editors, Linux is a disappointment because there\u2019s probably no Linux edition for adobe Photoshop.  \n Now, Linux also has an in built application called Disk Analyser. It is an application which tells you what folder has been eating, rather reserving your disk space. It is very useful application in that way because it lets you know what to delete to free your space. It not only tells you about your file system but tells you the \u2018free space sharing\u2019 on any other device that you connect. In this case, windows gets defeated. It\u2019s not having an in built application for this, so, you\u2019ll have to wander-on-the-web to get one!  \n I\u2019ve heard that Linux produces outstanding graphics but I haven\u2019t seen it in action and therefore I tell you about that so sure. But I think that it would be able to produce out-standing graphics because it\u2019s swift. Windows and other operating system themselves allocate very high memory and therefore they have relatively less to dedicate for graphics. Whereas in Linux, this case is totally different. Linux itself uses very less of your RAM as well as your hard drive. So, it can dedicate more graphics to your games and all that stuff. This is just a guess and I am not so sure about it. Built-in games of Linux are very standard \u2013 sort of only two-dimensional and therefore, you cannot judge its actual capacity. However, some of real 3D games are available but aren\u2019t satisfactory because they aren\u2019t developed that passionately. I purely do not mean to discourage or hurt the Linux game developers but despite of such nice capabilities of Linux to handle the resources you won\u2019t get any game on Linux that can compete the one on windows. This might be because the real \u2018expert\u2019 game developers are looking for money and hence they are moving towards development of games for windows as most of the high-end games in windows aren\u2019t free. Now, you might be wondering about 3D modelling software like Maya? As of now, I haven\u2019t encountered any such software but I am still looking for it. There must be some sort of software available on Linux. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll obviously find one.\n\n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Speed with appearance?<\/span>**  \n This is very easy question to answer \u2013\u00a0You compromise speed, you\u2019ll get speed.\u00a0But after you use Linux, you\u2019ll probably disagree with this. Even after using themes and effects, you\u2019ll observe that your working speed has been little affected. Shocked? I was too but I soon discovered this myself on my computer. Of course, you might suffer from a sort of decrease in speed at first but this decrease in speed will be rather unnoticed by you unless you are using a computer that\u2019s got a configuration which is just on the minimum system requirements of Linux. Now, if you know this, then there are different window managers in Linux. Most popular and used is GNOME. Still, there are two other types called KDE and Xfce. GNOME is for a computer user who wants both speed and appearance. KDE is for one who wants very cool appearance, mostly for high-fi users. Xfce us mostly used by users who have very low system requirements and want speed. Now, this is not always true because some users who just don\u2019t care about appearance even after having a high-end system use Xfce. Another one, which is not a window manager (Though most of users think it is), is Compiz Fusion. It accelerates the appearance of your system and allows you to perform a lot more tweaks like changing the open\/close\/minimize\/maximize animations, window borders, various effects and things like modifying the application switcher method. All these will be better understood by you if you use hands on approach and get at least a Live CD of Ubuntu Linux. Different window managers provide their own options of modifying the appearance on Linux while on windows? You know, you\u2019ll have to stick to the like or not Windows own window manager. Now this is mostly attracting to users but if you consider old versions, then they weren\u2019t attractive. But now, considering Windows Vista and Windows 7, they seem to be cool. Still, you don\u2019t get options of really \u2018modifying\u2019 them. Don\u2019t tell me about the \u2018themes\u2019 option. That\u2019s of no use. If you want to change desktop background and other sorts of things without affecting the real appearance, then it\u2019s better to do it yourself rather than depending on it.  \n Still thinking of Windows? Think again! Because Linux is used by huge servers and supercomputers. It\u2019s their choice because they rely on the usability, flexibility and resource management of Linux. Shouldn\u2019t you rely on it?\n\n\n","html":"<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-6AZtjxIA7T4\/T5pVHechtVI\/AAAAAAAAABM\/aLap_UYPpA8\/s1600\/windows_tux.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-6AZtjxIA7T4\/T5pVHechtVI\/AAAAAAAAABM\/aLap_UYPpA8\/s320\/windows_tux.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"173\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>Well, I wrote the following article a year ago.

Practically, Windows is created only by Microsoft Corporation while Linux has been created and tweaked by entire world! Why entire world? Because, it&#8217;s open source. If I have Linux and I find a bug, then I can tweak and remove that thing myself. I also tell the organization about the bug which I fixed. So, they verify it and tell their rest of the consumers about the fix. So, that&#8217;s how it all works. With windows, it is not like that. I must appreciate Microsoft\u2019s efforts in improving windows because in new versions of windows \u2013 The Vista Series \u2013 they have put an improved version of error reporting like\u00a0Problems Report and Solutions. With that you can just submit the error report. You cannot tell them how to fix that even if you know. Of course, you cannot fix grave errors in windows even if you think because it&#8217;s not open source!<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<p><a style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-mOMRW4ouf7Y\/T5pWKF5b9HI\/AAAAAAAAABs\/CHSczwEImQU\/s1600\/debian.png\"><br \/>\n<\/a><br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Who&#8217;s better on performance?<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<a style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-ofHO8h4jRIo\/T5pXXKotT0I\/AAAAAAAAAB8\/NoBlGPqy6zM\/s1600\/linuxdistros.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-ofHO8h4jRIo\/T5pXXKotT0I\/AAAAAAAAAB8\/NoBlGPqy6zM\/s1600\/linuxdistros.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>Practically, on considering stable releases of Linux offered by several organizations like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc., no doubt Linux outperforms Windows. Windows has always been a bulky operating system taking several minutes to boot up, then a minute to get stable and so on. While with Linux, running on an average PC, booting up is a child&#8217;s play for Linux, 10 \u2013 15 seconds is a limit. Even if &#8216;background processing&#8217; indicator on mouse cursor is on, you can still get your stuff by clicking. Exploring your computer is just with double-click of a button. You&#8217;ll never find this speed on Windows!<br \/>\nAlso, shutting down your PC is a matter of 5-6 seconds for Linux. And what&#8217;s more? Linux works on a 1 GHz PC with 128 MB RAM and even 10 GB Hard Drive!<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">What&#8217;s your colour today?<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nUnlike Windows, Linux provides a lot of customization features. It is so flexible that you can customize almost everything. From changing your wallpaper to behaviour and animation of minimizing\/maximizing a window, you can change and tweak everything. Linux also provides various desktop effects \u2013 some of which even require a 3D card \u2013 which are super cool.<br \/>\nFor Linux, wallpapers are billions, themes are millions, and yet there are thousands of programs that help even more to customize Linux. Also various types of desktop environment are available on Linux like GNOME (Most common with cool GUI), KDE (High end graphical interface), and Xfce (Fastest of all). These desktop environments not only handle the look and feel of the Linux environment but also provide you with lot of other flexibilities. Instead of trying out new desktop environments, I prefer to GNOME and its cool Compiz-Fusion Desktop effects which tweak almost all aspects of the operating system. In customization, Linux easily overcomes Windows.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Applications?<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nThis is where Linux gets outperformed. Almost 91% of the applications available in the market run on windows. 5% work on Mac OS X, 3% of it in Linux and the rest are for other OS. Windows has its roots wide-spread all over the world because it was the first OS to offer the idea of multi-tasking and a lot more new features that were not even thought of at that time. While Linux \u2013 which is not that old but still is not as old as windows \u2013 has relatively very less number of applications available worldwide. Linux is rapidly getting wide spread in the world of computing because it is a lot more flexible and offers a lot more possibilities than Windows. Linux offers its developers great flexibility of working with applications. Previously, Linux was called non-user friendly because it was difficult to operate but now that it has been tweaked and is available in several forms, Linux has removed this badge of dishonour from itself.<br \/>\nOrganizations like Ubuntu etc. have made Linux user friendly and easy to use operating system that provides its users with number of options which makes it easy to use.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Running Windows on Linux?<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<a style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-6VLcWKZuVcE\/T5pX_QdaB4I\/AAAAAAAAACE\/yPpkNoerhOQ\/s1600\/wine-windows.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-6VLcWKZuVcE\/T5pX_QdaB4I\/AAAAAAAAACE\/yPpkNoerhOQ\/s1600\/wine-windows.png\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>Also, now you can run Windows applications on Linux. With &#8216;Wine&#8217; \u2013 an application for Linux \u2013 you can run windows applications and programs on Linux. Wine uses its DLL library to run Windows applications. If you dual boot Windows and Linux, then it&#8217;ll be better. Wine uses Windows library and its own library in combination to run the application smoothly. Wine also has configuration screen where, you can select in which mode Wine should work. There are several modes available based on Windows OS Released. On my Linux, there are following modes:<br \/>\n\u2022 Windows Vista<br \/>\n\u2022\u00a0Windows XP<br \/>\n\u2022\u00a0Windows Me<br \/>\n\u2022 Windows 98<br \/>\n\u2022 Windows 3.0<br \/>\nAnd several others including server editions which I cannot recall right now.<br \/>\nEach of these modes create a separate environment for the application to run smoothly. Here, environment does not mean that your Linux look would change. You won&#8217;t even notice that! So, are you thinking of running Windows Games on your Linux? Don&#8217;t dream that! It won&#8217;t run. Games are called as hefty softwares that require large amount of resources and also they have some of functions which are accessible to them in Windows but not in Linux. However, these people are trying a lot to make each and every application of Windows run on Linux. Good luck to them!<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Where&#8217;s the security?<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nLinux has security from viruses. Don&#8217;t think that an antivirus system has been integrated to it. It isn&#8217;t in this case. Because, Linux does not support viruses! Yes, Viruses don&#8217;t run on Linux because they find it hard to harass you while you are logged in. Surprised? Ok, let\u2019s be frank. There&#8217;s one virus on Linux and that&#8217;s \u2013 Bliss. But just think of it. Linux has just one virus to support while Windows is entirely surrounded by viruses. Viruses for Windows \u2013 maybe billions \u2013 Viruses for Linux \u2013 Just One!! And that too is not going to do any big thing to your computer! So, here we have arrived to the point where we must say that Linux is too stout to respond to viruses. Consider a case where a burglar has entered a bank, he shows a gun, fires in the air and expects people to panic. But what happens? People ignore him! He shoots at the cashier but finds that his guns do not work against him. Bullets just fall down touching the cashier! This is the case when virus enters into Linux. Virus would try hard to do harm but Linux won&#8217;t execute any operations that virus has told. Virus will try to infiltrate your files but that also would not work because unlike windows, Linux is not having applications chained.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Little things that matter!<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nYet, there are a lot of little things offered by Linux that provide great advantage over Windows. First of all, Linux has a &#8216;Force Quit&#8217; feature. If you find any misbehaving application (Though you&#8217;ll rarely find) that&#8217;s taking too long to respond, you can use Force Quit. Force quit is a utility provided in Linux which immediately exits a non-responding application. So, you won&#8217;t need to wait minutes for a non-responding application to end. Sometimes, you&#8217;ll find that in windows, when an application does not respond, then your computer will also not respond. This happens because in windows, all applications are chained. When running applications are chained, they all get affected if one of them stops responding. This is not the case in Linux, In Linux, applications work independently, meaning, that they are not chained. So, if any damn application gets &#8216;hanged&#8217; your computer and other applications will continue working in full swing. Second advantage in Linux, that it has an in-built archive manager. With archive manager, you can handle multiple types of archives without installing a separate program for it. Linux also has a highly advanced calculator with three extended modes which are\u00a0&#8216;Advanced&#8217;, &#8216;Financial&#8217;\u00a0and\u00a0&#8216;Programming&#8217;. Linux also comes with Password and Encryption key manager which allows you to create passwords for applications and folders. It also allows you to create encryption keys whose strength ranges from 2048 bits to 4096 bits. With that, you can encrypt archives, files and folders to ensure that they are safe. Many Linux editions also allow you to change the way login screen looks and behaviour of the boot loader and its appearance. Linux also allows you to scale CPU usage. Meaning, you can set how much of the CPU power Linux should use. This helps you a lot in saving power. Suppose, you are reading an eBook on your Linux PC during a journey, if you were using windows, and even in power saver mode, you&#8217;ll drain a lot of battery. But in Linux, it dims the display automatically. Now, reading an eBook does not require processing power. So, you can set the value to least mode. In this way, Linux will stop most of background processes which drain battery and will ensure that the battery is saved. Now, as were discussing about battery, it reminds me of an amazing feature that Linux provides. Linux has an in-built system that provides detailed information on the battery installed on your laptop. It includes details like your battery model, version, status, and vendor. These details are common in windows. Excluding these, it also tells you details about battery technology, serial number, current charge capacity of battery(in %), current charge(in watt-hour), last full charge(in watt-hour) and design charge(in watt-hour). It also provides you with information based on graphs too! I&#8217;m sure that these features are not available on windows.<br \/>\nIf you refer to new versions of windows, in Vista line, you\u2019ll find that they are having preview panes. The moment, you select an item, its preview (if available) is shown in the preview pane. Previews are available for pictures, music, videos and some other types. Suppose, I click a music file. If my computer or rather Windows media player has that plugin, then it will show a mini media player in the preview pane with a play button. If I click play button, it will search the plugin in Windows Media library and then it will play the file. On my VAIO BZ, windows music preview does not work correctly. For the first file I play on starting the computer, it takes a lot of time in loading the preview pane. After that it plays the file. Now, Ubuntu Linux 9.04 has something new to offer. Now, unlike windows, Ubuntu has a &#8216;Movie Player&#8217; as default player. While exploring my computer, if I stumble upon a music file which I want to preview, I simply hover my mouse over it and immediately, it&#8217;ll start playing the file. But unfortunately in this technique, pausing is not possible. If I move down my mouse from that music file, the file immediately stops playing. Ubuntu also does not offer a seek bar!<br \/>\nAlso, there&#8217;s one thing where Linux surrenders. It&#8217;s Silverlight Experience! At Windows, you have Silverlight integrated in Windows Internet Explorer as well as many other web browsers like Firefox. But, in Ubuntu (or I assume in most of Linux operating systems) Silverlight isn&#8217;t available. Yes, if you do visit a website featuring Silverlight, it&#8217;ll tell you to download an alternative version of Silverlight as moonlight but even after downloading moon light, I can&#8217;t get Silverlight experience \u2013 It still says that Silverlight is missing.<br \/>\nSo, what do you learn from this? Most of all high-end Microsoft technologies aren&#8217;t shared by Microsoft.<br \/>\nFor all Photoshop editors, Linux is a disappointment because there&#8217;s probably no Linux edition for adobe Photoshop.<br \/>\nNow, Linux also has an in built application called Disk Analyser. It is an application which tells you what folder has been eating, rather reserving your disk space. It is very useful application in that way because it lets you know what to delete to free your space. It not only tells you about your file system but tells you the &#8216;free space sharing&#8217; on any other device that you connect. In this case, windows gets defeated. It&#8217;s not having an in built application for this, so, you&#8217;ll have to wander-on-the-web to get one!<br \/>\nI&#8217;ve heard that Linux produces outstanding graphics but I haven&#8217;t seen it in action and therefore I tell you about that so sure. But I think that it would be able to produce out-standing graphics because it&#8217;s swift. Windows and other operating system themselves allocate very high memory and therefore they have relatively less to dedicate for graphics. Whereas in Linux, this case is totally different. Linux itself uses very less of your RAM as well as your hard drive. So, it can dedicate more graphics to your games and all that stuff. This is just a guess and I am not so sure about it. Built-in games of Linux are very standard \u2013 sort of only two-dimensional and therefore, you cannot judge its actual capacity. However, some of real 3D games are available but aren&#8217;t satisfactory because they aren&#8217;t developed that passionately. I purely do not mean to discourage or hurt the Linux game developers but despite of such nice capabilities of Linux to handle the resources you won&#8217;t get any game on Linux that can compete the one on windows. This might be because the real &#8216;expert&#8217; game developers are looking for money and hence they are moving towards development of games for windows as most of the high-end games in windows aren&#8217;t free. Now, you might be wondering about 3D modelling software like Maya? As of now, I haven&#8217;t encountered any such software but I am still looking for it. There must be some sort of software available on Linux. Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll obviously find one.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Speed with appearance?<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nThis is very easy question to answer \u2013\u00a0You compromise speed, you&#8217;ll get speed.\u00a0But after you use Linux, you&#8217;ll probably disagree with this. Even after using themes and effects, you&#8217;ll observe that your working speed has been little affected. Shocked? I was too but I soon discovered this myself on my computer. Of course, you might suffer from a sort of decrease in speed at first but this decrease in speed will be rather unnoticed by you unless you are using a computer that&#8217;s got a configuration which is just on the minimum system requirements of Linux. Now, if you know this, then there are different window managers in Linux. Most popular and used is GNOME. Still, there are two other types called KDE and Xfce. GNOME is for a computer user who wants both speed and appearance. KDE is for one who wants very cool appearance, mostly for high-fi users. Xfce us mostly used by users who have very low system requirements and want speed. Now, this is not always true because some users who just don&#8217;t care about appearance even after having a high-end system use Xfce. Another one, which is not a window manager (Though most of users think it is), is Compiz Fusion. It accelerates the appearance of your system and allows you to perform a lot more tweaks like changing the open\/close\/minimize\/maximize animations, window borders, various effects and things like modifying the application switcher method. All these will be better understood by you if you use hands on approach and get at least a Live CD of Ubuntu Linux. Different window managers provide their own options of modifying the appearance on Linux while on windows? You know, you&#8217;ll have to stick to the like or not Windows own window manager. Now this is mostly attracting to users but if you consider old versions, then they weren&#8217;t attractive. But now, considering Windows Vista and Windows 7, they seem to be cool. Still, you don&#8217;t get options of really &#8216;modifying&#8217; them. Don&#8217;t tell me about the &#8216;themes&#8217; option. That&#8217;s of no use. If you want to change desktop background and other sorts of things without affecting the real appearance, then it&#8217;s better to do it yourself rather than depending on it.<br \/>\nStill thinking of Windows? Think again! Because Linux is used by huge servers and supercomputers. It&#8217;s their choice because they rely on the usability, flexibility and resource management of Linux. Shouldn&#8217;t you rely on it?<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 01:11:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 22:37:30 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 01:11:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":35,"title":"API for recognizing gestures in Android","slug":"api-for-recognizing-gestures-in-android","markdown":"\nI have been busy lately.

Think about making something physical, like a wooden table. Your mind quickly starts creating steps leading to that goal. Something like this feels familiar?\n\n1. Buy lots of raw wood.\n2. Buy sandpaper.\n3. Buy varnish.\n4. Make four legs.\n5. Make table top.\n6. Apply sandpaper.\n7. Join it all up.\n8. Apply varnish.\n\nSorry, I\u2019m no expert in the art of table making but most of you would have a similar list of actions. This is linear, meaning that the table cannot be used at all unless all the steps are complete. If you don\u2019t have a dining table at all in your house, then you\u2019ll probably have to sit somewhere else to eat for a couple of days (depending on how good you are at making a wooden table).\n\nNow think about writing software, say a website to help out your friend sell hats for cats online. Automatically you\u2019ll start thinking:\n\n1. Design frontend.\n2. Develop backend.\n3. Implement frontend.\n4. Integrate payment systems.\n5. Integrate email notification service.\n6. Test.\n7. Deploy.\n8. Handover.\n\nThere\u2019s probably a lot of intermediary steps but this is the gist of it all. Again, if you look through carefully, your friend does not get her website unless all of the steps are complete.\n\nIterative development only means that instead of doing everything in linear sequential steps, you are doing it in cycles. Delivery is key here meaning that you should aim to deliver at least once by the end of each cycle but mature teams are able to deliver the product more than twice each cycle. Thinking in line with the Scrum methodology, each cycle (or sprint) can be one week or up to one month. In our case, if we choose that one cycle is one week, here\u2019s what it might look like:\n\n1. Cycle 1: 1. Design basic frontend.\n2. Implement mock backend.\n3. Implement basic frontend.\n4. Integrate mock payment system.\n5. Integrate mock email notification service.\n6. Deploy and deliver.\n2. Cycle 2: 1. Improve frontend design.\n2. Implement basic backend functionality still mocking rest.\n3. Implement improved frontend design.\n4. Integrate mock payment system.\n5. Integrate mock email notification service.\n6. Deploy and deliver.\n3. Cycle 3: 1. Implement more backend functionality.\n2. Revisit frontend designs.\n3. Implement frontend design changes.\n4. Integrate basic payment system.\n5. Integrate mock email notification service.\n6. Deploy and deliver.\n4. Cycle 4: 1. Implement more backend functionality.\n2. Revisit frontend designs.\n3. Implement frontend design changes.\n4. Integrate basic email notification service.\n5. Deploy and deliver.\n5. Cycle 5: 1. Implement more backend functionality.\n2. Integrate advanced payment system.\n3. Deploy and deliver.\n6. Cycle 6: 1. Implement more backend functionality.\n2. Revisit frontend designs.\n3. Implement frontend design changes.\n4. Integrate advanced email notification service.\n5. Deploy and deliver.\n\nHere, you are deploying and delivering the product to your friend every week so that she can inspect the whole flow. This also allows you to receive feedback regarding the entire product every week which is not possible in the linear way of doing things (as your product is not ready for your friend to look at until the end). Also you don\u2019t have to come up with all the cycles at once. You basically have to have the current cycle plus at least next two cycles within your sights.\n\nMocking things is very important in this flow as it helps your friend to \u201cfeel\u201d how the website will look at the end. The mocks allow her to go through the checkout flow as if it was actually there. It might seem like a waste of time as you are developing something that you know will get replaced at the end anyway, it still has tremendous value as there is nothing worse than the client changing her mind and wanting to go in a completely different direction towards the end of the project. The mocks allow the client to focus as they get to see the product as it is being developed while also giving you continuous feedback.\n\nWhile this was a simple example, it gets quite a bit complicated when new projects are undertaken in large scale organisations as there can be lack of clarity before a project is started. I\u2019ll do another post on the Scrum Framework for this sometime in near future but this post provides a base that can help you understand Scrum as it is also about iterative software development.\n\nAgain, if you observe the technological advancements that humans has achieved so far, you\u2019ll notice the iterative approach at large scale. We didn\u2019t aspire to build shiny cars from day one. We first started with the wheel, advanced to wheel barrow, horse cart, trains and then finally a built car.\n\nHope you enjoyed this article.

In our case, if we choose that one cycle is one week, here&#8217;s what it might look like:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cycle 1:\n<ol>\n<li>Design basic frontend.<\/li>\n<li>Implement mock backend.<\/li>\n<li>Implement basic frontend.<\/li>\n<li>Integrate mock payment system.<\/li>\n<li>Integrate mock email notification service.<\/li>\n<li>Deploy and deliver.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>Cycle 2:\n<ol>\n<li>Improve frontend design.<\/li>\n<li>Implement basic backend functionality still mocking rest.<\/li>\n<li>Implement improved frontend design.<\/li>\n<li>Integrate mock payment system.<\/li>\n<li>Integrate mock email notification service.<\/li>\n<li>Deploy and deliver.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>Cycle 3:\n<ol>\n<li>Implement more backend functionality.<\/li>\n<li>Revisit frontend designs.<\/li>\n<li>Implement frontend design changes.<\/li>\n<li>Integrate basic payment system.<\/li>\n<li>Integrate mock email notification service.<\/li>\n<li>Deploy and deliver.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>Cycle 4:\n<ol>\n<li>Implement more backend functionality.<\/li>\n<li>Revisit frontend designs.<\/li>\n<li>Implement frontend design changes.<\/li>\n<li>Integrate basic email notification service.<\/li>\n<li>Deploy and deliver.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>Cycle 5:\n<ol>\n<li>Implement more backend functionality.<\/li>\n<li>Integrate advanced payment system.<\/li>\n<li>Deploy and deliver.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>Cycle 6:\n<ol>\n<li>Implement more backend functionality.<\/li>\n<li>Revisit frontend designs.<\/li>\n<li>Implement frontend design changes.<\/li>\n<li>Integrate advanced email notification service.<\/li>\n<li>Deploy and deliver.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Here, you are deploying and delivering the product to your friend every week so that she can inspect the whole flow. This also allows you to receive feedback regarding the entire product every week which is not possible in the linear way of doing things (as your product is not ready for your friend to look at until the end). Also you don&#8217;t have to come up with all the cycles at once. You basically have to have the current cycle plus at least next two cycles within your sights.<\/p>\n<p>Mocking things is very important in this flow as it helps your friend to &#8220;feel&#8221; how the website will look at the end. The mocks allow her to go through the checkout flow as if it was actually there. It might seem like a waste of time as you are developing something that you know will get replaced at the end anyway, it still has tremendous value as there is nothing worse than the client changing her mind and wanting to go in a completely different direction towards the end of the project. The mocks allow the client to focus as they get to see the product as it is being developed while also giving you continuous feedback.<\/p>\n<p>While this was a simple example, it gets quite a bit complicated when new projects are undertaken in large scale organisations as there can be lack of clarity before a project is started. I&#8217;ll do another post on the Scrum Framework for this sometime in near future but this post provides a base that can help you understand Scrum as it is also about iterative software development.<\/p>\n<p>Again, if you observe the technological advancements that humans has achieved so far, you&#8217;ll notice the iterative approach at large scale. We didn&#8217;t aspire to build shiny cars from day one. We first started with the wheel, advanced to wheel barrow, horse cart, trains and then finally a built car.<\/p>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed this article. I&#8217;ll appreciate it very much if you could leave your thoughts in the comments
