It is like measurement scale for code efficiency. If you go in details, it can become complex. However, in this post, I\u2019ll explain how to get a rough idea of your code\u2019s efficiency.\n\nTo roughly calculate it, you need to know size of your problem which is \u2018n\u2019 in this case. Look through your code, and analyze the loops that you have. Basically, loops are the determining factor. If your code has 100 loops (not nested) then the efficiency is O(n). No matter what the number is, if your code has no nested loops, then the efficiency is still O(n). However, if you have one single nested loop, then efficiency is n2. Nested loops decrease efficiency of code. This is simply depicted by the fact that n2 is greater than n.\n\nTo write efficient code, it should be your goal to reduce number of nested loops. To do this, the best way is to reuse values that have been previously generated. My way to do this is by using connected methods. I will be discussing more about this in next posts.

In the end, the code would look like this:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"lang:c#\">public class QueryClass{\r\n\r\nprivate static string connectionString = \"...\";\r\n\r\npublic static OleDbDataReader runSelectQuery(string queryString){\r\nOleDbConnection dbConnection = new OleDbConnection(connectionString);\r\ndbConnection.Open();\r\n\/\/using the query string...\r\nOleDbCommand dbCommand = new OleDbCommand(queryString,dbConnection);\r\n\/\/since this is select query...\r\nOleDbDataReader dr = dbCommand.ExecuteReader();\r\nreturn dr;\r\n}\r\n}<\/pre>\n<p>Later, to access the method, you&#8217;ll just have to do:<\/p>\n<p><code>OleDbDataReader reader = QueryClass.runSelectQuery(\"SELECT * FROM Customers\");<br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\nComment below if you have any queries regarding the code.<\/p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_8\"><a class=\"a2a_button_evernote\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F01%2F20%2Fbest-way-to-query-database-in-visual-c%2F&amp;linkname=Best%20way%20to%20query%20database%20in%20Visual%20C%23\" title=\"Evernote\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F01%2F20%2Fbest-way-to-query-database-in-visual-c%2F&amp;linkname=Best%20way%20to%20query%20database%20in%20Visual%20C%23\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F01%2F20%2Fbest-way-to-query-database-in-visual-c%2F&amp;linkname=Best%20way%20to%20query%20database%20in%20Visual%20C%23\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F01%2F20%2Fbest-way-to-query-database-in-visual-c%2F&amp;linkname=Best%20way%20to%20query%20database%20in%20Visual%20C%23\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F01%2F20%2Fbest-way-to-query-database-in-visual-c%2F&amp;linkname=Best%20way%20to%20query%20database%20in%20Visual%20C%23\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share\"><\/a><\/div><\/div>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 15:44:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 22:56:22 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 15:44:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":51,"title":"Using Sessions in ASP .NET","slug":"using-sessions-in-asp-net","markdown":"\nWell, believe it or not, Session is the most important thing when it comes to web design. I used to hate it but now I am a big fan of it. Trust me. You will like it once you get hang of it. So, in this post, I will be teaching you about using them. First of all, a session is like a small memory pit where you can store values. Values in session are lost once the browser closes. However, they stay the same even if you change the page or open new tab. Hence, sessions are used to pass values from one page to another.\n\nYou can store an object in session. It can be int, double, string or any other FooClass object that you have defined. This is the main benefit of it. However, when taking values back, you need to make sure that you cast them back to its same original form. Here\u2019s how you store value in a session. Let me define some variables.\n\n```\nint i=2;<br><\/br>\nstring s=\"Hello\";<br><\/br>\nFooClass foo = new FooClass();<br><\/br>```\n\nNow, I will store each of them in session. To store a value, you need to give a session name. This must be unique. You must remember this because you will have to use it to extract value out of session. Here\u2019s how you do it:\n\n```\nSession[\"someIntegerVariable\"] = i;<br><\/br>\nSession[\"someStringVariable\"] = s;<br><\/br>\nSession[\"someFooClassObject\"] = foo;<br><\/br>```\n\nNow that I have all of them in the session, I will extract them. Remember, I can only extract variable \u2018i\u2019 from \u2018someIntegerVariable\u2019 session and not \u2018someStringVariable\u2019 session.\n\n```\nint newI = (int)Session[\"someIntegerVariable\"];<br><\/br>\nstring newS = (string)Session[\"someStringVariable\"];<br><\/br>\nFooClass = (FooClass)Session[\"someFooClassObject\"];<br><\/br>```\n\nSince session stores object only, you will have to cast the object back to its original form. In the code above, I have casted the object stored in \u2018someIntegerVariable\u2019 session back to its original form which is int.\n\nThat\u2019s basically how you use sessions.

First of all, you need two textboxes, one for username and another for password. I\u2019ll call them usernameTextBox and passwordTextBox for this example. Drag down a button and call it loginButton. Now, in the OnClick event of loginButton, you need to check if the provided combination of username and password is correct or not. You can only do this if you have username and passwords stored somewhere. It is recommended to use a database to do this. Create a AccountDetails table in your database. The table should have username and password fields, both as text (VARCHAR for SQL). The way login is going to work is that you select records from AccountDetails table who have the provided username and password. This query should return one row if the combination matches. If not, then it should return nothing. Here\u2019s the query you need to pass:\n\n`string query = \"SELECT * FROM AccountDetails WHERE username='\"+usernameTextBox.Text + \"' AND pass='\" + passwordTextBox.Text + \"'\";<br><\/br>`Supply this query to the command object. This can be OleDbCommand or SqlCommand depending on your type of database. Invoke the ExecuteReader method of the command object and then check if the Read method of the DataReader object returns true. If it does then this means that the login is successful. If not, then login is invalid. Here\u2019s a sample code.\n\n```\nstring connectionString = \"...\";<br><\/br>\nOleDbConnection conn = new OleDbConnection(connectionString);<br><\/br>\nconn.Open();<br><\/br>\nstring queryString = \"SELECT * FROM AccountDetails WHERE username='\"+usernameTextBox.Text + \"' AND pass='\" + passwordTextBox.Text + \"'\";<br><\/br>\nOleDbCommand command = new OleDbCommand(queryString, conn);<br><\/br>\nOleDbDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();<br><\/br>\nif(reader.Read()){<br><\/br>\n\/\/Login is successful.<br><\/br>\n}else{<br><\/br>\n\/\/Login failed.<br><\/br>\n}<br><\/br>```\nThats it! Your ASP website should now have a wonderful login to allow geniune users. To extend its capabilities, store the username in a session and then in PageLoad event of rest of the pages which require login, check if the session contains something. If it is null, then the page should redirect to login page. Same if for log-out. In the PageLoad event of the login page, check if the session username contains something. If it does, then clear out the session and display some notification saying that the user has been logged out. Now, in your page, to which the user gets redirected after successful login, put a simple link to login.\n\nNow, initially when user lands on the login page, the session username will be empty. However, on typing correct username and password, this session gets filled with the username of the logged user and he\/she is redirected to some sort of dashboard page. When the user clicks on the log-out link, he\/she gets redirected to the login page which first checks if there is anything in the session. Since the user has previously logged in, there will be a username inside that session. Login page clears it out and displays a message saying that the user has been logged out.

It is awesome. This time, I\u2019ll get started straight away!\n\nFirst of all, before making a thread in java, you need a runnable. Runnable is basically like a piece of code that you want to execute as a separate thread. There are two ways to create a runnable. You can do it by making an anonymous class such as:\n\n`Runnable r = new Runnable(){`  \n```\n<br><\/br>\npublic void run(){<br><\/br>```\n  \n` \/\/Your code goes here...<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"><br><\/br><\/span>`  \n```\n }<br><\/br>\n}<br><\/br>```\nHowever, this is not a good practice. Hence, it is advised to create a separate class which implements the Runnable interface like:\n\n``  \n`public class MyNewRunnable implements Runnable{`  \n`<br><\/br>`  \n` MyNewRunnable(){`  \n`<br><\/br>`  \n` }`  \n`<br><\/br>`  \n` public void run(){`  \n` \/\/Your code here...`  \n` }`  \n`}`\n\n<div>`\u00a0`<\/div>``In this manner, you can pass any parameters for processing the information using the class constructor. For instance, if you are making a runnable for downloading files, you can pass url of the file through the class constructor.

It is awesome. This time, I&#8217;ll get started straight away!<\/p>\n<p>First of all, before making a thread in java, you need a runnable. Runnable is basically like a piece of code that you want to execute as a separate thread. There are two ways to create a runnable. You can do it by making an anonymous class such as:<\/p>\n<p><code>Runnable r = new Runnable(){<\/code><br \/>\n<code><br \/>\npublic void run(){<br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\n<code> \/\/Your code goes here...<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/code><br \/>\n<code> }<br \/>\n}<br \/>\n<\/code>However, this is not a good practice. Hence, it is advised to create a separate class which implements the Runnable interface like:<\/p>\n<p><code><\/code><br \/>\n<code>public class MyNewRunnable implements Runnable{<\/code><br \/>\n<code><br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\n<code> MyNewRunnable(){<\/code><br \/>\n<code><br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\n<code> }<\/code><br \/>\n<code><br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\n<code> public void run(){<\/code><br \/>\n<code> \/\/Your code here...<\/code><br \/>\n<code> }<\/code><br \/>\n<code>}<\/code><\/p>\n<div><code>\u00a0<\/code><\/div>\n<p><code><\/code>In this manner, you can pass any parameters for processing the information using the class constructor. For instance, if you are making a runnable for downloading files, you can pass url of the file through the class constructor. Now, once you have created your runnable, you need a thread in which you have to put the runnable. Then you run the thread, the run method of runnable gets executed. For runnable r, you can make a thread as follows:<\/p>\n<p><code>Thread t = new Thread(r);<br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\nThen, you can start the thread by typing:<\/p>\n<p><code>t.start();<br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\nI&#8217;d say that threading would help make your program more responsive. This is solely because of the fact that all the heavy processor hungry tasks are carried out in a separate thread and the UI thread is kept clean.<\/p>\n<p>See Also: <a href=\"http:\/\/codeninjutsu.blogspot.com\/2012\/01\/how-do-i-do-threading-in-c.html\">How do I do threading in C#?<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_14\"><a class=\"a2a_button_evernote\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F01%2F24%2Fhow-do-i-do-threaded-programming-in-java%2F&amp;linkname=Multi-threaded%20programming%20in%20Java\" title=\"Evernote\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F01%2F24%2Fhow-do-i-do-threaded-programming-in-java%2F&amp;linkname=Multi-threaded%20programming%20in%20Java\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F01%2F24%2Fhow-do-i-do-threaded-programming-in-java%2F&amp;linkname=Multi-threaded%20programming%20in%20Java\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F01%2F24%2Fhow-do-i-do-threaded-programming-in-java%2F&amp;linkname=Multi-threaded%20programming%20in%20Java\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F01%2F24%2Fhow-do-i-do-threaded-programming-in-java%2F&amp;linkname=Multi-threaded%20programming%20in%20Java\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share\"><\/a><\/div><\/div>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 20:55:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 23:25:21 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 20:55:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":48,"title":"Writing multi-threaded code in C#","slug":"how-do-i-do-threading-in-c","markdown":"\nThreading in C# is no big deal.

However, it is an important concept and thus needs to be covered. First of all, to time a certain task, you will have to make a Timer object. However, a timer object needs to have a TimerTask object. Now, TimerTask is an abstract class and has a run method which gets called on set frequency. So, for instance, if the frequency of the task has been set to 2000 ms, then the run method gets called every 2000 ms. To use Timers, you will have to create your own class which extends the TimerTask class. This would be something like:\n\n```\n\u00a0public class SomeTask extends TimerTask{<br><\/br>\n@Override<br><\/br>\npublic void run() {<br><\/br>\n\/\/Something to do here...<br><\/br>\n}<br><\/br>\n}```\n\nIf you are going to access UI elements of a particular JFrame from your SomeTask class, then you will have to pass a reference of that JFrame in its class constructor. This is because all your UI elements are private and thus cannot be accessed by an external class. You will also have to make methods which would access your private UI elements in the NewJFrame. For a JFrame called NewJFrame, the code would look like:\n\n`public class SomeTask extends TimerTask{`\n\nNewJFrame parent;  \n public SomeTask(NewJFrame frame){  \n parent = frame;  \n }\n\n@Override  \n public void run() {  \n \/\/Do work here  \n }  \n }\n\nIf you want to type Hello every five seconds to a JTextArea in NewJFrame, then you\u2019ll first have to create a method that would do that in your NewJFrame. This method can be as simple as:\n\n```\npublic void type(){<br><\/br>\njTextArea1.append(\"Hellon\");<br><\/br>\n}```\n\nNow, access this method from the run() method of your timer task simply by:\n\n`parent.type();`\n\nTo run this task, you will have to make a timer by:\n\n`Timer t = new Timer();`\n\nThen, create a new object of SomeTask class that you just created.\n\n`SomeTask st = new SomeTask(this);`\n\nNotice \u2018this\u2019 in the constructor. It is because we asked for it in the class constructor as the task needs to access the UI elements. Now schedule that task by:\n\n`t.schedule(st,0,2000);`\n\nThe above line takes three parameters. First is the TimerTask object, which in this case is the SomeTask object called st. Second is the intial delay (in ms) which is concerned with how long will it take to start the task for the first time and the third parameter is the frequency of the task which in this case is 2000 ms.\n\nThats it! Now you have scheduled your task and it will run almost instantly (0 ms delay). It will keep running every 2 seconds (2000 ms) until someone calls:\n\n`st.cancel();`\n\nWhich will stop the task from running.\n\nWatch the video tutorial here:\n\n<center><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-loYJQsE3TY\" width=\"480\"><\/iframe><\/center><div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_29\">[](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F17%2Fhow-to-use-timers-in-java%2F&linkname=Using%20Timer%20in%20Java \"Evernote\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F17%2Fhow-to-use-timers-in-java%2F&linkname=Using%20Timer%20in%20Java \"Facebook\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F17%2Fhow-to-use-timers-in-java%2F&linkname=Using%20Timer%20in%20Java \"Twitter\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F17%2Fhow-to-use-timers-in-java%2F&linkname=Using%20Timer%20in%20Java \"Google+\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F17%2Fhow-to-use-timers-in-java%2F&linkname=Using%20Timer%20in%20Java \"LinkedIn\") [](https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share)<\/div><\/div>\n","html":"<p>Well, this post will be similar to the one about Threading.

A YEAR AGO! I\u2019m actually amazed that I wrote such a thing. Well, so\u2026 Here it goes\u2026\n\nLinux, as you all know, is a free-open source operating system. Inspire of having number of advantages over Windows, Linux is still free and of course open source. Now, you might be thinking why I\u2019m using terms \u2018free\u2019 and \u2018open\u2019 source separately. \u2018Free\u2019 means that Linux is freely available and downloadable from internet. Some of the vendors like \u2018Ubuntu\u2019 offer CDs loaded with Linux absolutely free of cost. Open source means that if you know kernel programming and mechanics of operating system, then you can actually tweak Linux and also program Linux from a scratch. That\u2019s open source and Linux provides that flexibility. Unlike Linux, Windows is not open source. It does not allow user to modify its kernel or components. This is one of the reasons why Linux is hot favourite among young developers.\n\n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">What separates them?<\/span>**  \n The main difference between Linux and windows is their build. Practically, Windows is created only by Microsoft Corporation while Linux has been created and tweaked by entire world! Why entire world? Because, it\u2019s open source. If I have Linux and I find a bug, then I can tweak and remove that thing myself. I also tell the organization about the bug which I fixed. So, they verify it and tell their rest of the consumers about the fix. So, that\u2019s how it all works. With windows, it is not like that. I must appreciate Microsoft\u2019s efforts in improving windows because in new versions of windows \u2013 The Vista Series \u2013 they have put an improved version of error reporting like\u00a0Problems Report and Solutions. With that you can just submit the error report. You cannot tell them how to fix that even if you know. Of course, you cannot fix grave errors in windows even if you think because it\u2019s not open source!\n\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><\/div>[  \n](http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-mOMRW4ouf7Y\/T5pWKF5b9HI\/AAAAAAAAABs\/CHSczwEImQU\/s1600\/debian.png)  \n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Who\u2019s better on performance?<\/span>**  \n[![](http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-ofHO8h4jRIo\/T5pXXKotT0I\/AAAAAAAAAB8\/NoBlGPqy6zM\/s1600\/linuxdistros.jpg)](http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-ofHO8h4jRIo\/T5pXXKotT0I\/AAAAAAAAAB8\/NoBlGPqy6zM\/s1600\/linuxdistros.jpg)Practically, on considering stable releases of Linux offered by several organizations like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc., no doubt Linux outperforms Windows. Windows has always been a bulky operating system taking several minutes to boot up, then a minute to get stable and so on. While with Linux, running on an average PC, booting up is a child\u2019s play for Linux, 10 \u2013 15 seconds is a limit. Even if \u2018background processing\u2019 indicator on mouse cursor is on, you can still get your stuff by clicking. Exploring your computer is just with double-click of a button. You\u2019ll never find this speed on Windows!  \n Also, shutting down your PC is a matter of 5-6 seconds for Linux. And what\u2019s more? Linux works on a 1 GHz PC with 128 MB RAM and even 10 GB Hard Drive!\n\n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">What\u2019s your colour today?<\/span>**  \n Unlike Windows, Linux provides a lot of customization features. It is so flexible that you can customize almost everything. From changing your wallpaper to behaviour and animation of minimizing\/maximizing a window, you can change and tweak everything. Linux also provides various desktop effects \u2013 some of which even require a 3D card \u2013 which are super cool.  \n For Linux, wallpapers are billions, themes are millions, and yet there are thousands of programs that help even more to customize Linux. Also various types of desktop environment are available on Linux like GNOME (Most common with cool GUI), KDE (High end graphical interface), and Xfce (Fastest of all). These desktop environments not only handle the look and feel of the Linux environment but also provide you with lot of other flexibilities. Instead of trying out new desktop environments, I prefer to GNOME and its cool Compiz-Fusion Desktop effects which tweak almost all aspects of the operating system. In customization, Linux easily overcomes Windows.\n\n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Applications?<\/span>**  \n This is where Linux gets outperformed. Almost 91% of the applications available in the market run on windows. 5% work on Mac OS X, 3% of it in Linux and the rest are for other OS. Windows has its roots wide-spread all over the world because it was the first OS to offer the idea of multi-tasking and a lot more new features that were not even thought of at that time. While Linux \u2013 which is not that old but still is not as old as windows \u2013 has relatively very less number of applications available worldwide. Linux is rapidly getting wide spread in the world of computing because it is a lot more flexible and offers a lot more possibilities than Windows. Linux offers its developers great flexibility of working with applications. Previously, Linux was called non-user friendly because it was difficult to operate but now that it has been tweaked and is available in several forms, Linux has removed this badge of dishonour from itself.  \n Organizations like Ubuntu etc. have made Linux user friendly and easy to use operating system that provides its users with number of options which makes it easy to use.\n\n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Running Windows on Linux?<\/span>**  \n[![](http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-6VLcWKZuVcE\/T5pX_QdaB4I\/AAAAAAAAACE\/yPpkNoerhOQ\/s1600\/wine-windows.png)](http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-6VLcWKZuVcE\/T5pX_QdaB4I\/AAAAAAAAACE\/yPpkNoerhOQ\/s1600\/wine-windows.png)Also, now you can run Windows applications on Linux. With \u2018Wine\u2019 \u2013 an application for Linux \u2013 you can run windows applications and programs on Linux. Wine uses its DLL library to run Windows applications. If you dual boot Windows and Linux, then it\u2019ll be better. Wine uses Windows library and its own library in combination to run the application smoothly. Wine also has configuration screen where, you can select in which mode Wine should work. There are several modes available based on Windows OS Released. On my Linux, there are following modes:  \n \u2022 Windows Vista  \n \u2022\u00a0Windows XP  \n \u2022\u00a0Windows Me  \n \u2022 Windows 98  \n \u2022 Windows 3.0  \n And several others including server editions which I cannot recall right now.  \n Each of these modes create a separate environment for the application to run smoothly. Here, environment does not mean that your Linux look would change. You won\u2019t even notice that! So, are you thinking of running Windows Games on your Linux? Don\u2019t dream that! It won\u2019t run. Games are called as hefty softwares that require large amount of resources and also they have some of functions which are accessible to them in Windows but not in Linux. However, these people are trying a lot to make each and every application of Windows run on Linux. Good luck to them!\n\n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Where\u2019s the security?<\/span>**  \n Linux has security from viruses. Don\u2019t think that an antivirus system has been integrated to it. It isn\u2019t in this case. Because, Linux does not support viruses! Yes, Viruses don\u2019t run on Linux because they find it hard to harass you while you are logged in. Surprised? Ok, let\u2019s be frank. There\u2019s one virus on Linux and that\u2019s \u2013 Bliss. But just think of it. Linux has just one virus to support while Windows is entirely surrounded by viruses. Viruses for Windows \u2013 maybe billions \u2013 Viruses for Linux \u2013 Just One!! And that too is not going to do any big thing to your computer! So, here we have arrived to the point where we must say that Linux is too stout to respond to viruses. Consider a case where a burglar has entered a bank, he shows a gun, fires in the air and expects people to panic. But what happens? People ignore him! He shoots at the cashier but finds that his guns do not work against him. Bullets just fall down touching the cashier! This is the case when virus enters into Linux. Virus would try hard to do harm but Linux won\u2019t execute any operations that virus has told. Virus will try to infiltrate your files but that also would not work because unlike windows, Linux is not having applications chained.\n\n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Little things that matter!<\/span>**  \n Yet, there are a lot of little things offered by Linux that provide great advantage over Windows. First of all, Linux has a \u2018Force Quit\u2019 feature. If you find any misbehaving application (Though you\u2019ll rarely find) that\u2019s taking too long to respond, you can use Force Quit. Force quit is a utility provided in Linux which immediately exits a non-responding application. So, you won\u2019t need to wait minutes for a non-responding application to end. Sometimes, you\u2019ll find that in windows, when an application does not respond, then your computer will also not respond. This happens because in windows, all applications are chained. When running applications are chained, they all get affected if one of them stops responding. This is not the case in Linux, In Linux, applications work independently, meaning, that they are not chained. So, if any damn application gets \u2018hanged\u2019 your computer and other applications will continue working in full swing. Second advantage in Linux, that it has an in-built archive manager. With archive manager, you can handle multiple types of archives without installing a separate program for it. Linux also has a highly advanced calculator with three extended modes which are\u00a0\u2018Advanced\u2019, \u2018Financial\u2019\u00a0and\u00a0\u2018Programming\u2019. Linux also comes with Password and Encryption key manager which allows you to create passwords for applications and folders. It also allows you to create encryption keys whose strength ranges from 2048 bits to 4096 bits. With that, you can encrypt archives, files and folders to ensure that they are safe. Many Linux editions also allow you to change the way login screen looks and behaviour of the boot loader and its appearance. Linux also allows you to scale CPU usage. Meaning, you can set how much of the CPU power Linux should use. This helps you a lot in saving power. Suppose, you are reading an eBook on your Linux PC during a journey, if you were using windows, and even in power saver mode, you\u2019ll drain a lot of battery. But in Linux, it dims the display automatically. Now, reading an eBook does not require processing power. So, you can set the value to least mode. In this way, Linux will stop most of background processes which drain battery and will ensure that the battery is saved. Now, as were discussing about battery, it reminds me of an amazing feature that Linux provides. Linux has an in-built system that provides detailed information on the battery installed on your laptop. It includes details like your battery model, version, status, and vendor. These details are common in windows. Excluding these, it also tells you details about battery technology, serial number, current charge capacity of battery(in %), current charge(in watt-hour), last full charge(in watt-hour) and design charge(in watt-hour). It also provides you with information based on graphs too! I\u2019m sure that these features are not available on windows.  \n If you refer to new versions of windows, in Vista line, you\u2019ll find that they are having preview panes. The moment, you select an item, its preview (if available) is shown in the preview pane. Previews are available for pictures, music, videos and some other types. Suppose, I click a music file. If my computer or rather Windows media player has that plugin, then it will show a mini media player in the preview pane with a play button. If I click play button, it will search the plugin in Windows Media library and then it will play the file. On my VAIO BZ, windows music preview does not work correctly. For the first file I play on starting the computer, it takes a lot of time in loading the preview pane. After that it plays the file. Now, Ubuntu Linux 9.04 has something new to offer. Now, unlike windows, Ubuntu has a \u2018Movie Player\u2019 as default player. While exploring my computer, if I stumble upon a music file which I want to preview, I simply hover my mouse over it and immediately, it\u2019ll start playing the file. But unfortunately in this technique, pausing is not possible. If I move down my mouse from that music file, the file immediately stops playing. Ubuntu also does not offer a seek bar!  \n Also, there\u2019s one thing where Linux surrenders. It\u2019s Silverlight Experience! At Windows, you have Silverlight integrated in Windows Internet Explorer as well as many other web browsers like Firefox. But, in Ubuntu (or I assume in most of Linux operating systems) Silverlight isn\u2019t available. Yes, if you do visit a website featuring Silverlight, it\u2019ll tell you to download an alternative version of Silverlight as moonlight but even after downloading moon light, I can\u2019t get Silverlight experience \u2013 It still says that Silverlight is missing.  \n So, what do you learn from this? Most of all high-end Microsoft technologies aren\u2019t shared by Microsoft.  \n For all Photoshop editors, Linux is a disappointment because there\u2019s probably no Linux edition for adobe Photoshop.  \n Now, Linux also has an in built application called Disk Analyser. It is an application which tells you what folder has been eating, rather reserving your disk space. It is very useful application in that way because it lets you know what to delete to free your space. It not only tells you about your file system but tells you the \u2018free space sharing\u2019 on any other device that you connect. In this case, windows gets defeated. It\u2019s not having an in built application for this, so, you\u2019ll have to wander-on-the-web to get one!  \n I\u2019ve heard that Linux produces outstanding graphics but I haven\u2019t seen it in action and therefore I tell you about that so sure. But I think that it would be able to produce out-standing graphics because it\u2019s swift. Windows and other operating system themselves allocate very high memory and therefore they have relatively less to dedicate for graphics. Whereas in Linux, this case is totally different. Linux itself uses very less of your RAM as well as your hard drive. So, it can dedicate more graphics to your games and all that stuff. This is just a guess and I am not so sure about it. Built-in games of Linux are very standard \u2013 sort of only two-dimensional and therefore, you cannot judge its actual capacity. However, some of real 3D games are available but aren\u2019t satisfactory because they aren\u2019t developed that passionately. I purely do not mean to discourage or hurt the Linux game developers but despite of such nice capabilities of Linux to handle the resources you won\u2019t get any game on Linux that can compete the one on windows. This might be because the real \u2018expert\u2019 game developers are looking for money and hence they are moving towards development of games for windows as most of the high-end games in windows aren\u2019t free. Now, you might be wondering about 3D modelling software like Maya? As of now, I haven\u2019t encountered any such software but I am still looking for it. There must be some sort of software available on Linux. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll obviously find one.\n\n**<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Speed with appearance?<\/span>**  \n This is very easy question to answer \u2013\u00a0You compromise speed, you\u2019ll get speed.\u00a0But after you use Linux, you\u2019ll probably disagree with this. Even after using themes and effects, you\u2019ll observe that your working speed has been little affected. Shocked? I was too but I soon discovered this myself on my computer. Of course, you might suffer from a sort of decrease in speed at first but this decrease in speed will be rather unnoticed by you unless you are using a computer that\u2019s got a configuration which is just on the minimum system requirements of Linux. Now, if you know this, then there are different window managers in Linux. Most popular and used is GNOME. Still, there are two other types called KDE and Xfce. GNOME is for a computer user who wants both speed and appearance. KDE is for one who wants very cool appearance, mostly for high-fi users. Xfce us mostly used by users who have very low system requirements and want speed. Now, this is not always true because some users who just don\u2019t care about appearance even after having a high-end system use Xfce. Another one, which is not a window manager (Though most of users think it is), is Compiz Fusion. It accelerates the appearance of your system and allows you to perform a lot more tweaks like changing the open\/close\/minimize\/maximize animations, window borders, various effects and things like modifying the application switcher method. All these will be better understood by you if you use hands on approach and get at least a Live CD of Ubuntu Linux. Different window managers provide their own options of modifying the appearance on Linux while on windows? You know, you\u2019ll have to stick to the like or not Windows own window manager. Now this is mostly attracting to users but if you consider old versions, then they weren\u2019t attractive. But now, considering Windows Vista and Windows 7, they seem to be cool. Still, you don\u2019t get options of really \u2018modifying\u2019 them. Don\u2019t tell me about the \u2018themes\u2019 option. That\u2019s of no use. If you want to change desktop background and other sorts of things without affecting the real appearance, then it\u2019s better to do it yourself rather than depending on it.  \n Still thinking of Windows? Think again! Because Linux is used by huge servers and supercomputers. It\u2019s their choice because they rely on the usability, flexibility and resource management of Linux. Shouldn\u2019t you rely on it?\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_31\">[](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F27%2Flinux-windows-comparison%2F&linkname=Linux%20vs%20Windows%20comparison \"Evernote\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F27%2Flinux-windows-comparison%2F&linkname=Linux%20vs%20Windows%20comparison \"Facebook\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F27%2Flinux-windows-comparison%2F&linkname=Linux%20vs%20Windows%20comparison \"Twitter\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F27%2Flinux-windows-comparison%2F&linkname=Linux%20vs%20Windows%20comparison \"Google+\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F27%2Flinux-windows-comparison%2F&linkname=Linux%20vs%20Windows%20comparison \"LinkedIn\") [](https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share)<\/div><\/div>\n","html":"<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-6AZtjxIA7T4\/T5pVHechtVI\/AAAAAAAAABM\/aLap_UYPpA8\/s1600\/windows_tux.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-6AZtjxIA7T4\/T5pVHechtVI\/AAAAAAAAABM\/aLap_UYPpA8\/s320\/windows_tux.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"173\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>Well, I wrote the following article a year ago. A YEAR AGO! I&#8217;m actually amazed that I wrote such a thing. Well, so&#8230; Here it goes&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Linux, as you all know, is a free-open source operating system. Inspire of having number of advantages over Windows, Linux is still free and of course open source. Now, you might be thinking why I&#8217;m using terms &#8216;free&#8217; and &#8216;open&#8217; source separately. &#8216;Free&#8217; means that Linux is freely available and downloadable from internet. Some of the vendors like &#8216;Ubuntu&#8217; offer CDs loaded with Linux absolutely free of cost. Open source means that if you know kernel programming and mechanics of operating system, then you can actually tweak Linux and also program Linux from a scratch. That&#8217;s open source and Linux provides that flexibility. Unlike Linux, Windows is not open source. It does not allow user to modify its kernel or components. This is one of the reasons why Linux is hot favourite among young developers.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">What separates them?<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nThe main difference between Linux and windows is their build. Practically, Windows is created only by Microsoft Corporation while Linux has been created and tweaked by entire world! Why entire world? Because, it&#8217;s open source. If I have Linux and I find a bug, then I can tweak and remove that thing myself. I also tell the organization about the bug which I fixed. So, they verify it and tell their rest of the consumers about the fix. So, that&#8217;s how it all works. With windows, it is not like that.

Linux also has a highly advanced calculator with three extended modes which are\u00a0&#8216;Advanced&#8217;, &#8216;Financial&#8217;\u00a0and\u00a0&#8216;Programming&#8217;. Linux also comes with Password and Encryption key manager which allows you to create passwords for applications and folders. It also allows you to create encryption keys whose strength ranges from 2048 bits to 4096 bits. With that, you can encrypt archives, files and folders to ensure that they are safe. Many Linux editions also allow you to change the way login screen looks and behaviour of the boot loader and its appearance. Linux also allows you to scale CPU usage. Meaning, you can set how much of the CPU power Linux should use. This helps you a lot in saving power. Suppose, you are reading an eBook on your Linux PC during a journey, if you were using windows, and even in power saver mode, you&#8217;ll drain a lot of battery. But in Linux, it dims the display automatically. Now, reading an eBook does not require processing power. So, you can set the value to least mode. In this way, Linux will stop most of background processes which drain battery and will ensure that the battery is saved. Now, as were discussing about battery, it reminds me of an amazing feature that Linux provides. Linux has an in-built system that provides detailed information on the battery installed on your laptop. It includes details like your battery model, version, status, and vendor. These details are common in windows. Excluding these, it also tells you details about battery technology, serial number, current charge capacity of battery(in %), current charge(in watt-hour), last full charge(in watt-hour) and design charge(in watt-hour). It also provides you with information based on graphs too! I&#8217;m sure that these features are not available on windows.<br \/>\nIf you refer to new versions of windows, in Vista line, you\u2019ll find that they are having preview panes. The moment, you select an item, its preview (if available) is shown in the preview pane. Previews are available for pictures, music, videos and some other types. Suppose, I click a music file. If my computer or rather Windows media player has that plugin, then it will show a mini media player in the preview pane with a play button. If I click play button, it will search the plugin in Windows Media library and then it will play the file. On my VAIO BZ, windows music preview does not work correctly. For the first file I play on starting the computer, it takes a lot of time in loading the preview pane. After that it plays the file. Now, Ubuntu Linux 9.04 has something new to offer. Now, unlike windows, Ubuntu has a &#8216;Movie Player&#8217; as default player. While exploring my computer, if I stumble upon a music file which I want to preview, I simply hover my mouse over it and immediately, it&#8217;ll start playing the file. But unfortunately in this technique, pausing is not possible. If I move down my mouse from that music file, the file immediately stops playing. Ubuntu also does not offer a seek bar!<br \/>\nAlso, there&#8217;s one thing where Linux surrenders. It&#8217;s Silverlight Experience! At Windows, you have Silverlight integrated in Windows Internet Explorer as well as many other web browsers like Firefox. But, in Ubuntu (or I assume in most of Linux operating systems) Silverlight isn&#8217;t available. Yes, if you do visit a website featuring Silverlight, it&#8217;ll tell you to download an alternative version of Silverlight as moonlight but even after downloading moon light, I can&#8217;t get Silverlight experience \u2013 It still says that Silverlight is missing.<br \/>\nSo, what do you learn from this? Most of all high-end Microsoft technologies aren&#8217;t shared by Microsoft.<br \/>\nFor all Photoshop editors, Linux is a disappointment because there&#8217;s probably no Linux edition for adobe Photoshop.<br \/>\nNow, Linux also has an in built application called Disk Analyser. It is an application which tells you what folder has been eating, rather reserving your disk space. It is very useful application in that way because it lets you know what to delete to free your space. It not only tells you about your file system but tells you the &#8216;free space sharing&#8217; on any other device that you connect. In this case, windows gets defeated. It&#8217;s not having an in built application for this, so, you&#8217;ll have to wander-on-the-web to get one!<br \/>\nI&#8217;ve heard that Linux produces outstanding graphics but I haven&#8217;t seen it in action and therefore I tell you about that so sure. But I think that it would be able to produce out-standing graphics because it&#8217;s swift. Windows and other operating system themselves allocate very high memory and therefore they have relatively less to dedicate for graphics. Whereas in Linux, this case is totally different. Linux itself uses very less of your RAM as well as your hard drive. So, it can dedicate more graphics to your games and all that stuff. This is just a guess and I am not so sure about it. Built-in games of Linux are very standard \u2013 sort of only two-dimensional and therefore, you cannot judge its actual capacity. However, some of real 3D games are available but aren&#8217;t satisfactory because they aren&#8217;t developed that passionately. I purely do not mean to discourage or hurt the Linux game developers but despite of such nice capabilities of Linux to handle the resources you won&#8217;t get any game on Linux that can compete the one on windows. This might be because the real &#8216;expert&#8217; game developers are looking for money and hence they are moving towards development of games for windows as most of the high-end games in windows aren&#8217;t free. Now, you might be wondering about 3D modelling software like Maya? As of now, I haven&#8217;t encountered any such software but I am still looking for it. There must be some sort of software available on Linux. Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll obviously find one.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Speed with appearance?<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nThis is very easy question to answer \u2013\u00a0You compromise speed, you&#8217;ll get speed.\u00a0But after you use Linux, you&#8217;ll probably disagree with this. Even after using themes and effects, you&#8217;ll observe that your working speed has been little affected. Shocked? I was too but I soon discovered this myself on my computer. Of course, you might suffer from a sort of decrease in speed at first but this decrease in speed will be rather unnoticed by you unless you are using a computer that&#8217;s got a configuration which is just on the minimum system requirements of Linux. Now, if you know this, then there are different window managers in Linux. Most popular and used is GNOME. Still, there are two other types called KDE and Xfce. GNOME is for a computer user who wants both speed and appearance. KDE is for one who wants very cool appearance, mostly for high-fi users. Xfce us mostly used by users who have very low system requirements and want speed. Now, this is not always true because some users who just don&#8217;t care about appearance even after having a high-end system use Xfce. Another one, which is not a window manager (Though most of users think it is), is Compiz Fusion. It accelerates the appearance of your system and allows you to perform a lot more tweaks like changing the open\/close\/minimize\/maximize animations, window borders, various effects and things like modifying the application switcher method. All these will be better understood by you if you use hands on approach and get at least a Live CD of Ubuntu Linux. Different window managers provide their own options of modifying the appearance on Linux while on windows? You know, you&#8217;ll have to stick to the like or not Windows own window manager. Now this is mostly attracting to users but if you consider old versions, then they weren&#8217;t attractive. But now, considering Windows Vista and Windows 7, they seem to be cool. Still, you don&#8217;t get options of really &#8216;modifying&#8217; them. Don&#8217;t tell me about the &#8216;themes&#8217; option. That&#8217;s of no use. If you want to change desktop background and other sorts of things without affecting the real appearance, then it&#8217;s better to do it yourself rather than depending on it.<br \/>\nStill thinking of Windows? Think again! Because Linux is used by huge servers and supercomputers. It&#8217;s their choice because they rely on the usability, flexibility and resource management of Linux. Shouldn&#8217;t you rely on it?<\/p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_32\"><a class=\"a2a_button_evernote\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F27%2Flinux-windows-comparison%2F&amp;linkname=Linux%20vs%20Windows%20comparison\" title=\"Evernote\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F27%2Flinux-windows-comparison%2F&amp;linkname=Linux%20vs%20Windows%20comparison\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F27%2Flinux-windows-comparison%2F&amp;linkname=Linux%20vs%20Windows%20comparison\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F27%2Flinux-windows-comparison%2F&amp;linkname=Linux%20vs%20Windows%20comparison\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2012%2F04%2F27%2Flinux-windows-comparison%2F&amp;linkname=Linux%20vs%20Windows%20comparison\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share\"><\/a><\/div><\/div>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 01:11:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 22:37:30 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 01:11:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":35,"title":"API for recognizing gestures in Android","slug":"api-for-recognizing-gestures-in-android","markdown":"\nI have been busy lately.

You need to make change in the following two lines:<\/p>\n<p><code>$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] = '<b><u>root<\/u><\/b>';\u00a0<\/code><br \/>\n<code>$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = '<b><u>password<\/u><\/b>' <\/code><\/p>\n<p>The underlined parts are the ones that you&#8217;ve got to change. This file contains a lot of admin stuff so make sure you look around a bit and understand what it does.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know what you are doing, ensure you take a backup of the file before changing things.<\/p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_44\"><a class=\"a2a_button_evernote\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2013%2F04%2F20%2Fchanging-mysql-username-and-password-used-by-phpmyadmin%2F&amp;linkname=Changing%20MySQL%20username%20and%20password%20used%20by%20PHPMyAdmin\" title=\"Evernote\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2013%2F04%2F20%2Fchanging-mysql-username-and-password-used-by-phpmyadmin%2F&amp;linkname=Changing%20MySQL%20username%20and%20password%20used%20by%20PHPMyAdmin\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2013%2F04%2F20%2Fchanging-mysql-username-and-password-used-by-phpmyadmin%2F&amp;linkname=Changing%20MySQL%20username%20and%20password%20used%20by%20PHPMyAdmin\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2013%2F04%2F20%2Fchanging-mysql-username-and-password-used-by-phpmyadmin%2F&amp;linkname=Changing%20MySQL%20username%20and%20password%20used%20by%20PHPMyAdmin\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2013%2F04%2F20%2Fchanging-mysql-username-and-password-used-by-phpmyadmin%2F&amp;linkname=Changing%20MySQL%20username%20and%20password%20used%20by%20PHPMyAdmin\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share\"><\/a><\/div><\/div>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 10:09:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 23:08:47 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 10:09:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":28,"title":"Setting up C++ build system on Linux","slug":"compiling-c-easily-on-linux-easy-c-build-system","markdown":"\nI was developing some C++ stuff on my Linux virtual machine and wanted to create something that would make it easy for me to compile C++ code.

In my final year, one of the courses that I am studying is Programming Frameworks. This course introduces to the academic side of Software Engineering and covers topics like quality plans, quality control, advanced methodologies, planning, frameworks etc.<\/div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">My coursework for this course was to prepare a quality plan for writing an academic paper and then write the academic paper. The main topic of the academic paper was to compare and contrast one of the three concepts with an academic paper \u201cNo Silver Bullet \u2013 Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering\u201d written by Fred Brooks.

In my final year, one of the courses that I am studying is Programming Frameworks. This course introduces to the academic side of Software Engineering and covers topics like quality plans, quality control, advanced methodologies, planning, frameworks etc.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">My coursework for this course was to prepare a quality plan for writing an academic paper and then write the academic paper. The main topic of the academic paper was to compare and contrast one of the three concepts with an academic paper &#8220;No Silver Bullet &#8211; Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering&#8221; written by Fred Brooks. I prepared the quality plan, wrote the academic paper and submitted the coursework last month.

So, open up terminal and type:  \n`sudo plutil -convert xml1 \/Library\/Preferences\/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist`\n\nNow you can go on to finder or whatever you have and edit this file. Remove \u2026 followed by \u2026 tags which relate to the keyboard\/device that you are trying to ban. Simple way is to find the name of the device in the file. This name will be in \u2026 tags.

I was doing some prototyping with sparkpost and none of my code worked as by default the code wasn\u2019t going through the business proxy.\n\nNaturally, I thought that I\u2019d set HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables and then run my java code. I did and as it is with all things in Software Engineering industry, it didn\u2019t work.\n\nAfter several hours of googling (or what felt like several hours) I finally found what was wrong with it.

Some people like them and few enjoy them. Over the years, I\u2019ve worked across multiple companies who embrace Agile, particularly Scrum. I\u2019ve started my career with Agile and so far, I\u2019ve worked in organisations who are either mature Agile organisations or those who are transforming themselves into being Agile so I like to think that I have a pretty good grip on what an organisation\u2019s Agile ideals should be. However, ideal things don\u2019t happen in practice \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing because I don\u2019t think that all organisations can wear one single Agile hat.\n\nDifferent places have different ideas about what a refinement session should be about. Some think that its an opportunity to connect with the product owner at technical level while others think that it is an opportunity to itemize stories by capturing more detail in them. Then there are also some outliers who think that refinement should be about the dev team and how they feel about the stories that are in the backlog.\n\nI think that all of the above views are correct \u2013 up to an extent.\n\n**Refinement sessions provide an opportunity to connect with the product owner. **While, as an agile team, you should be regularly talking to your product owner, constantly getting feedback on your work anyway, refinement sessions allow the whole team to come together to review upcoming work in the backlog and at the same time, negotiate the required amount of work with the product owner. However, this shouldn\u2019t become a tug of war but rather an open dialogue where ideas are allowed to flow freely. This is an opportunity for the development team to connect with the product owner at \u2018why\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019 level so that they can find and apply meaning to their work.\n\n**Refinement sessions are about itemizing stories by packing as much detail in them as possible.** This is quite popular. I\u2019ve seen people getting into low level details during refinement, talking about \u2018how\u2019 instead of just \u2018what\u2019 and \u2018why\u2019. If you have highly technical people in your team, who know loads of stuff and are packed with experience, or just people who are highly motivated and just can\u2019t wait to start working, then either you\u2019re already having this mindset or will be facing it soon. Its not a sin to go into low level detail but it is when people go into it for too long. Remember, \u201cI want a API orchestration layer\u201d or \u201cI want my posts to be fetched from a JSON REST compatible API\u201d said no customer ever. Refinement sessions are about capturing enough detail from the user\u2019s point of view for the development team to get started.\n\n**Refinement sessions are about dev team and how they feel about the current state of the backlog.** Very few people see it from this point of view as most forget that it is a two way conversation between product owner and the development team. Product owners don\u2019t own the team. They own the backlog and the work that is in it. Development team has every right to negotiate items that are on there if they feel that it is the right thing to do for the team. Another development team might not feel the same way but that\u2019s not the point as they are not the ones working on it. In some cases, the backlog is not ready to be refined as items that are on it severely lack purpose, let alone the details. In this case, the product owner should go back to the drawing board and get the information that is required to give a story its meaning. The story can be skipped or the session can be ended if no story is fit enough for refinement.\n\nIn addition to complying with all the \u201crules\u201d, I think that the teams should also meta-refine refinement sessions. If they are becoming a chore find out why. Liven it up a bit. Change something, gamify, let someone else drive the sessions or try out new things in general. You\u2019ll eventually find a sweet spot.\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_93\">[](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F24%2Fdeveloper-code-of-conduct-for-scrum-refinement-ceremonies%2F&linkname=Developer%20code%20of%20conduct%20for%20Scrum%20Refinement%20ceremonies%20%28Scrum%20series%201%29 \"Evernote\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F24%2Fdeveloper-code-of-conduct-for-scrum-refinement-ceremonies%2F&linkname=Developer%20code%20of%20conduct%20for%20Scrum%20Refinement%20ceremonies%20%28Scrum%20series%201%29 \"Facebook\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F24%2Fdeveloper-code-of-conduct-for-scrum-refinement-ceremonies%2F&linkname=Developer%20code%20of%20conduct%20for%20Scrum%20Refinement%20ceremonies%20%28Scrum%20series%201%29 \"Twitter\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F24%2Fdeveloper-code-of-conduct-for-scrum-refinement-ceremonies%2F&linkname=Developer%20code%20of%20conduct%20for%20Scrum%20Refinement%20ceremonies%20%28Scrum%20series%201%29 \"Google+\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F24%2Fdeveloper-code-of-conduct-for-scrum-refinement-ceremonies%2F&linkname=Developer%20code%20of%20conduct%20for%20Scrum%20Refinement%20ceremonies%20%28Scrum%20series%201%29 \"LinkedIn\") [](https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share)<\/div><\/div>\n","html":"<p>Refinement sessions.

Another development team might not feel the same way but that&#8217;s not the point as they are not the ones working on it. In some cases, the backlog is not ready to be refined as items that are on it severely lack purpose, let alone the details. In this case, the product owner should go back to the drawing board and get the information that is required to give a story its meaning. The story can be skipped or the session can be ended if no story is fit enough for refinement.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to complying with all the &#8220;rules&#8221;, I think that the teams should also meta-refine refinement sessions. If they are becoming a chore find out why. Liven it up a bit. Change something, gamify, let someone else drive the sessions or try out new things in general. You&#8217;ll eventually find a sweet spot.<\/p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_94\"><a class=\"a2a_button_evernote\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F24%2Fdeveloper-code-of-conduct-for-scrum-refinement-ceremonies%2F&amp;linkname=Developer%20code%20of%20conduct%20for%20Scrum%20Refinement%20ceremonies%20%28Scrum%20series%201%29\" title=\"Evernote\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F24%2Fdeveloper-code-of-conduct-for-scrum-refinement-ceremonies%2F&amp;linkname=Developer%20code%20of%20conduct%20for%20Scrum%20Refinement%20ceremonies%20%28Scrum%20series%201%29\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F24%2Fdeveloper-code-of-conduct-for-scrum-refinement-ceremonies%2F&amp;linkname=Developer%20code%20of%20conduct%20for%20Scrum%20Refinement%20ceremonies%20%28Scrum%20series%201%29\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F24%2Fdeveloper-code-of-conduct-for-scrum-refinement-ceremonies%2F&amp;linkname=Developer%20code%20of%20conduct%20for%20Scrum%20Refinement%20ceremonies%20%28Scrum%20series%201%29\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F24%2Fdeveloper-code-of-conduct-for-scrum-refinement-ceremonies%2F&amp;linkname=Developer%20code%20of%20conduct%20for%20Scrum%20Refinement%20ceremonies%20%28Scrum%20series%201%29\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share\"><\/a><\/div><\/div>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 21:20:02 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 22:06:27 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 21:20:02 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":118,"title":"Finding a file contained within a bunch of tar files without opening any","slug":"finding-a-file-contained-within-a-bunch-of-tar-files-without-opening-any","markdown":"\nSo I was debugging some code the other day and I quickly found myself in a situation where I had to look for a class file that was located in one of the many millions of jar files that are there in my maven cache.

find a piece of text within loads of text files contained across multitude of tar files. In a normal case, you\u2019d extract them all somewhere in temp directory and then use grep to find the text you want. However, this doesn\u2019t work very well when the tar files you have are in thousands. Also, there is something uncool about doing stuff manually when you\u2019re in a world where there\u2019s always a better way.\n\nAfter an hour of experimentation, I found the following magic command:\n\n`find \/home\/manthan\/loads_of_tarfiles -name \"*.tar\" -type f -exec sh -c \"tar -tf {} | grep awesome | xargs -I found -n 1 tar -Oxf {} found | grep im\" \\; -print`\n\nThe above command finds all files (indicated by `-type f`) in `\/home\/manthan\/loads_of_tarfiles` folder with extension `.tar` (indicatetd by `-name \"*.tar\"`). For each file it finds, it runs a shell command (indicated by `-exec sh -c`) which lists all files contained within that tar file (indicated by `tar -tf {}`, where `{}` is each instance in which the find command found a tar file). For each file contained within the resident tar file, it then finds a text file whose name contains the word awesome (`grep awesome`). This can be anything as long as you know what kind of file you are looking for.\n\nFor each text file (whose name contains the word awesome) that is found within the tar file, it then extracts the contents of that file to `STDOUT` (indicated by `tar -Oxf {}` found where `{}` is the tar file that is found in the first part of the command and found is the text file that is found in the latter part of the command by the `grep awesome` command). Now that the contents of the file are available in `STDOUT`, a simple search finds the text we need in that file (using `grep im` which searches for text `im` within the extracted file). If it is found, the matching contents are printed and the name of the tar file it matched in is also printed (indicated by `-print`).\n\nPhew! That was lengthy. As usual, if you have any questions or find a better way, let me know in the comments below and I\u2019ll make sure to update the post with credits.

If it is found, the matching contents are printed and the name of the tar file it matched in is also printed (indicated by <code>-print<\/code>).<\/p>\n<p>Phew! That was lengthy. As usual, if you have any questions or find a better way, let me know in the comments below and I&#8217;ll make sure to update the post with credits.

Basically, if you want to write a web application in node.js, express is one of your options. I prefer it because of its simplicity.\n\nThe quickest way to write an express application is to use the express npm module. If you haven\u2019t got it, install it by executing:\n\n`npm install -g express`\n\nOnce installed, go to your projects folder, where you normally keep your projects and then execute:\n\n`express myawesomeproject`\n\nYou should see some output and hopefully no errors. This command creates a basic project structure under `myawesomeproject` directory with some files for you to quickly get started. Some notable files are `.\/bin\/www`, `.\/app.js` and `.\/routes\/index.js`.\n\nNow, `cd` into the project folder. You\u2019ll see several files and folders in that directory. Don\u2019t worry about that now. Let\u2019s get the application server up and running. However, before we can do that, we\u2019ll have to install the project dependencies. See the file called package.json? It defines the project and all its dependencies. NPM, being a dependency management system will go through the list of dependencies defined here and will then fetch them for you. If those dependencies have any tertiary dependencies then it\u2019ll fetch them as well. To install the dependencies, execute:\n\n`npm install`\n\nIf you have a working internet connection, then this should go smoothly. Now let\u2019s run the application. To do this, execute the following:\n\n`npm start`\n\nOpen your favourite web browser and navigate to the following url:\n\n`http:\/\/localhost:3000\/`\n\nYou should see a page with Welcome to myawesomeproject as its heading.\n\nAwesome work! You\u2019ve just created your first express web application.\n\nIn the next tutorial we\u2019ll go through the project structure to see how it all fits together.\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_107\">[](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F31%2Fup-and-running-with-express%2F&linkname=Up%20and%20running%20with%20Express%20%28Express%20series%201%29 \"Evernote\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F31%2Fup-and-running-with-express%2F&linkname=Up%20and%20running%20with%20Express%20%28Express%20series%201%29 \"Facebook\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F31%2Fup-and-running-with-express%2F&linkname=Up%20and%20running%20with%20Express%20%28Express%20series%201%29 \"Twitter\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F31%2Fup-and-running-with-express%2F&linkname=Up%20and%20running%20with%20Express%20%28Express%20series%201%29 \"Google+\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F08%2F31%2Fup-and-running-with-express%2F&linkname=Up%20and%20running%20with%20Express%20%28Express%20series%201%29 \"LinkedIn\") [](https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share)<\/div><\/div>\n","html":"<p>For those who don&#8217;t know, Express is a web server framework that runs on Node.js.

Think about making something physical, like a wooden table. Your mind quickly starts creating steps leading to that goal. Something like this feels familiar?\n\n1. Buy lots of raw wood.\n2. Buy sandpaper.\n3. Buy varnish.\n4. Make four legs.\n5. Make table top.\n6. Apply sandpaper.\n7. Join it all up.\n8. Apply varnish.\n\nSorry, I\u2019m no expert in the art of table making but most of you would have a similar list of actions. This is linear, meaning that the table cannot be used at all unless all the steps are complete. If you don\u2019t have a dining table at all in your house, then you\u2019ll probably have to sit somewhere else to eat for a couple of days (depending on how good you are at making a wooden table).\n\nNow think about writing software, say a website to help out your friend sell hats for cats online. Automatically you\u2019ll start thinking:\n\n1. Design frontend.\n2. Develop backend.\n3. Implement frontend.\n4. Integrate payment systems.\n5. Integrate email notification service.\n6. Test.\n7. Deploy.\n8. Handover.\n\nThere\u2019s probably a lot of intermediary steps but this is the gist of it all. Again, if you look through carefully, your friend does not get her website unless all of the steps are complete.\n\nIterative development only means that instead of doing everything in linear sequential steps, you are doing it in cycles. Delivery is key here meaning that you should aim to deliver at least once by the end of each cycle but mature teams are able to deliver the product more than twice each cycle. Thinking in line with the Scrum methodology, each cycle (or sprint) can be one week or up to one month. In our case, if we choose that one cycle is one week, here\u2019s what it might look like:\n\n1. Cycle 1: 1. Design basic frontend.\n2. Implement mock backend.\n3. Implement basic frontend.\n4. Integrate mock payment system.\n5. Integrate mock email notification service.\n6. Deploy and deliver.\n2. Cycle 2: 1. Improve frontend design.\n2. Implement basic backend functionality still mocking rest.\n3. Implement improved frontend design.\n4. Integrate mock payment system.\n5. Integrate mock email notification service.\n6. Deploy and deliver.\n3. Cycle 3: 1. Implement more backend functionality.\n2. Revisit frontend designs.\n3. Implement frontend design changes.\n4. Integrate basic payment system.\n5. Integrate mock email notification service.\n6. Deploy and deliver.\n4. Cycle 4: 1. Implement more backend functionality.\n2. Revisit frontend designs.\n3. Implement frontend design changes.\n4. Integrate basic email notification service.\n5. Deploy and deliver.\n5. Cycle 5: 1. Implement more backend functionality.\n2. Integrate advanced payment system.\n3. Deploy and deliver.\n6. Cycle 6: 1. Implement more backend functionality.\n2. Revisit frontend designs.\n3. Implement frontend design changes.\n4. Integrate advanced email notification service.\n5. Deploy and deliver.\n\nHere, you are deploying and delivering the product to your friend every week so that she can inspect the whole flow. This also allows you to receive feedback regarding the entire product every week which is not possible in the linear way of doing things (as your product is not ready for your friend to look at until the end). Also you don\u2019t have to come up with all the cycles at once. You basically have to have the current cycle plus at least next two cycles within your sights.\n\nMocking things is very important in this flow as it helps your friend to \u201cfeel\u201d how the website will look at the end. The mocks allow her to go through the checkout flow as if it was actually there. It might seem like a waste of time as you are developing something that you know will get replaced at the end anyway, it still has tremendous value as there is nothing worse than the client changing her mind and wanting to go in a completely different direction towards the end of the project. The mocks allow the client to focus as they get to see the product as it is being developed while also giving you continuous feedback.\n\nWhile this was a simple example, it gets quite a bit complicated when new projects are undertaken in large scale organisations as there can be lack of clarity before a project is started. I\u2019ll do another post on the Scrum Framework for this sometime in near future but this post provides a base that can help you understand Scrum as it is also about iterative software development.\n\nAgain, if you observe the technological advancements that humans has achieved so far, you\u2019ll notice the iterative approach at large scale. We didn\u2019t aspire to build shiny cars from day one. We first started with the wheel, advanced to wheel barrow, horse cart, trains and then finally a built car.\n\nHope you enjoyed this article.

Now its time to go through it in bit more detail. As the extension `.json` indicates, data in this file is in `json` format. Yours should look something like this:\n\n```\n{<br><\/br>\n\"name\": \"myawesomeproject\",<br><\/br>\n\"version\": \"0.0.0\",<br><\/br>\n\"private\": true,<br><\/br>\n\"scripts\": {<br><\/br>\n\"start\": \"node .\/bin\/www\"<br><\/br>\n},<br><\/br>\n\"dependencies\": {<br><\/br>\n\"body-parser\": \"~1.12.0\",<br><\/br>\n\"cookie-parser\": \"~1.3.4\",<br><\/br>\n\"debug\": \"~2.1.1\",<br><\/br>\n\"express\": \"~4.12.2\",<br><\/br>\n\"jade\": \"~1.9.2\",<br><\/br>\n\"morgan\": \"~1.5.1\",<br><\/br>\n\"serve-favicon\": \"~2.2.0\"<br><\/br>\n}```\n\nThe name and version fields indicate the project name and version respectively. The field private indicates that this is a private npm project. So, in case you were developing a npm module, this field will determine whether or not to allow you to publicly publish your project. The scripts field contains commands and the respective files that should be executed when the command is called. The two most popular ones here are start and test. As you can see, the express tool automatically generates the start script command and maps it to .\/bin\/www.\n\nThe last thing here is the dependencies field. This contains all the dependencies of your project. The tilda sign (`~`) prefixed in the version means that if a newer bug fix version is found then it\u2019ll update it to that automatically. For instance, in our case, the current version of express module is 4.12.2. In case a newer version 4.12.3 is released, the tilda sign means that npm will fetch that version. However, if express 4.13 is released, npm won\u2019t update to that. On the contrary, if the hat sign (`^`) was used, npm will update to 4.13 but will hold off for version 5.0.\n\n**app.js**  \n This file is the central point for configuring the express web server. It defines several things like the view engine, logging levels etc and loads all middleware components (more on that in later posts). You\u2019ll be visiting this file more often than you think once you start developing express web applications.\n\nIf you scroll down, you\u2019ll see that this file also loads routes. This is where the server routes are defined. In this case, the route file `index.js` is loaded in and all its routes are mapped from the root route (indicated by `\/`). In the next line it also loads another route file called `users.js`, routes of which are mapped from `\/users`.\n\n**routes**  \n This directory contains files that define different routes of the web application. You can define routes in multiple files here and then reference them in the `app.js` in parent folder. This helps to keep things separate from one another to avoid clutter. Although JavaScript has no concept of a \u201cclass\u201d, you can define various objects here and then re-use them across your various routes. We\u2019ll go over that in later posts.\n\n**views**  \n This directory contains all your templates. Since the default templating engine is Jade, you\u2019ll find files with `.jade` extension here. You can use one of the other options that express tool provides like ejs or handlebars or you can choose a completely different templating engine as well. Whatever you choose will have to be configured in the `app.js` file. The templates that have been defined here can be changed on the fly, meaning that changing the template while the application is running will have immediate effect. In contrast to this, if you change one of the javascript files, you\u2019ll have to restart the whole application. Check out Jade templating engine here [http:\/\/jade-lang.com\/](http:\/\/jade-lang.com\/)\n\n**public**  \n As the name suggests, this directory contains all the public assets. Whatever you place in here can be accessed without authentication as these are the assets that pages normally require to render. Any files here can be referenced from root level. For instance, a stylesheet named `style.css` located in stylesheets folder in public directory can be accessed by `\/stylesheets\/style.css` from the web server. You can create as many sub directories as you want without making any configuration changes in `app.js`.\n\nExcellent! Now you know what different parts of an express web app does. In the next post we\u2019ll create our first RESTful web service using Express.

This time, we\u2019ll actually modify some of the code to create our own RESTful web service.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what a RESTful web service is, you should check out the [wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Representational_state_transfer) entry for it.\n\nAs discussed in the previous post, all of our routes are defined in files located in the routes folder which are then referenced and collated in the app.js file. So, to create our own RESTful API, we need to do something in this area.\n\nLets checkout the `index.js` file and see whats in it.\n\nvar express = require('express'); var router = express.Router(); \/* GET home page. *\/ router.get('\/', function(req, res, next) { res.render('index', { title: 'Express' }); }); module.exports = router;\n\nThis is the typical structure of any nodejs module. Top section is to declare dependencies and instantiate objects. Middle part is to actually do things. And the final bottom part is to clean up and export the module. This file says that when the root (`\/`) is accessed by a HTTP GET method (indicated by `router.get`), call a function. This function is defined as `function(req, res, next) {...}`. The three variables, `req`, `res` and `next` are function parameters. I won\u2019t go into the details regarding basic JavaScript in any of these tutorials. If you have any questions, check out some of many JavaScript resources available on the web.\n\nThese parameters `req`, `res` and `next` are the request object, the response object and the function call to the next module in the middle ware stack respectively. The line `res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });` is using the render function of the response object, asking express to render the template `'index'` with parameters specified by the JSON object `{ title: 'Express' }`. Since Express knows that we are using Jade templating engine (defined in `app.js`), it will go to the views folder and find the file named `index.jade` and will render it.\n\nRight, so now that\u2019s out of the way, lets go and create our own service. For the purpose of this tutorial, we\u2019ll create a health check web service. When it gets called, it will return `OK` status indicating that the server health is ok. Since this will require a GET request to be invoked, we\u2019ll be using router.get and hence the first line of the code will be very similar to the already existing one.\n\nrouter.get('\/', function(req, res, next) { \/\/ My health check API });\n\n``Next, we need to change two things. One is the URL reference. Currently, its set to `'\/'`. Because this has already been defined, lets modify it to our own path. This can be anything you want but for the sake of simplicity, lets make it `\/healthcheck`. Your code should now look like this:\n\nrouter.get('\/healthcheck', function(req, res, next) { \/\/ My health check API });\n\n``The code doesn\u2019t do anything yet. Lets change that. Remove the comment `<strong>\/\/ My health check API<\/strong>` and put the following logic in it.\n\nvar statusString = 'OK'; return res.send(statusString);\n\n``After your change, the file `index.js` should look like this:\n\nvar express = require('express'); var router = express.Router(); \/* GET home page. *\/ router.get('\/', function(req, res, next) { res.render('index', { title: 'Express' }); }); router.get('\/healthcheck', function(req, res, next) { var statusString = 'OK'; return res.send(statusString); }); module.exports = router;\n\nAwesome. Now go back to your command line and run `npm start` command to start your server. Once started, go to `http:\/\/localhost:3000\/healthcheck` on your web browser. You should see the following output:\n\n`OK`\n\nNow this isn\u2019t very clean as its returning plain text instead of proper JSON response. Shut down the server and go back to your IDE. Modify the code in the `\/healthcheck` router in `index.js` to be the following:\n\nvar statusObject = {status: 'OK'}; return res.send(statusObject);\n\n``Start the server and navigate back to `http:\/\/localhost:3000\/healthcheck` in your browser. You should see a JSON response this time:\n\n{ \"status\": \"OK\" }\n\nGreat work! You\u2019ve just written your first RESTful web service in Node.js using Express! In the next post we\u2019ll take this to a next level and migrate what we\u2019ve written to a separate file to reduce clutter and make the code a bit cleaner.

Your code should now look like this:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"lang:js decode:true \">router.get('\/healthcheck', function(req, res, next) {\r\n\/\/ My health check API\r\n});<\/pre>\n<p><code><\/code>The code doesn&#8217;t do anything yet. Lets change that. Remove the comment <code><strong>\/\/ My health check API<\/strong><\/code> and put the following logic in it.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"lang:js decode:true \">var statusString = 'OK';\r\nreturn res.send(statusString);<\/pre>\n<p><code><\/code>After your change, the file <code>index.js<\/code> should look like this:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"lang:js decode:true \">var express = require('express');\r\nvar router = express.Router();\r\n\r\n\/* GET home page. *\/\r\nrouter.get('\/', function(req, res, next) {\r\nres.render('index', { title: 'Express' });\r\n});\r\n\r\nrouter.get('\/healthcheck', function(req, res, next) {\r\nvar statusString = 'OK';\r\nreturn res.send(statusString);\r\n});\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = router;<\/pre>\n<p>Awesome. Now go back to your command line and run <code>npm start<\/code> command to start your server. Once started, go to <code>http:\/\/localhost:3000\/healthcheck<\/code> on your web browser. You should see the following output:<\/p>\n<p><code>OK<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Now this isn&#8217;t very clean as its returning plain text instead of proper JSON response. Shut down the server and go back to your IDE. Modify the code in the <code>\/healthcheck<\/code> router in <code>index.js<\/code> to be the following:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"lang:js decode:true \">var statusObject = {status: 'OK'};\r\nreturn res.send(statusObject);<\/pre>\n<p><code><\/code>Start the server and navigate back to <code>http:\/\/localhost:3000\/healthcheck<\/code> in your browser. You should see a JSON response this time:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"lang:default decode:true \">{\r\n\r\n\"status\": \"OK\"\r\n\r\n}<\/pre>\n<p>Great work! You&#8217;ve just written your first RESTful web service in Node.js using Express! In the next post we&#8217;ll take this to a next level and migrate what we&#8217;ve written to a separate file to reduce clutter and make the code a bit cleaner.

At Angular Connect 2015","slug":"notes-from-whats-new-in-typescript-at-angular-connect-2015","markdown":"\n**1100**\n\nDay One\n\nWhat\u2019s new in Typescript? By Bill Ticehurst\n\nGoals is to make javascript development more productive and enjoyable.\n\nHard to work in code bases with lack of types. Hard to debug.\n\nSuperset of javascript that compiles into plain javascript. Simple mapping. Makes it easy to debug, back and forth.\n\nES 6 sounds futuristic. Once you get used to it, it\u2019s hard to go back.\n\nStatic types allow better documentation which in turn gives better tooling. Allows jumping around points in code easier.\n\nTypes are optional. Don\u2019t need to have types everywhere. Kinda like code coverage. Do what you need.\n\nNow showing demos. There\u2019s a plugin available for sublime which helps writing Typescript easier. Now urging audience to find bugs in presented demo code. Interfaces help debug code as it sets expectations for assignable types.\n\nLive stack trace. Bugs and trace disappears as you fix them. How cool is that?\n\nDebugging in this thing is amazing. Errors are helpful and intellisense is better as the code knows things!\n\nA variable can have more than one type. Like string or a string array. In this case, the Typescript expects common methods in both types to be valid. If specific methods needs to be used then need to cast or parse it.\n\nGenerics!\n\n\u201cthis demo has blown my mind.\u201d\n\nNow showing a demo with angular.\n\nImports works dynamically with node modules. It just works!\n\nUrging developers to start distributing Typescript files along with their modules.\n\nDecorators are able to interfere with the declaration of an object. Logger decorator injects function before execution of the target function.\n\nReflection API.

By Bill Ticehurst <\/p>\n<p>Goals is to make javascript development more productive and enjoyable. <\/p>\n<p>Hard to work in code bases with lack of types. Hard to debug. <\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Superset of javascript that compiles into plain javascript. Simple mapping. Makes it easy to debug, back and forth. <\/p>\n<p>ES 6 sounds futuristic. Once you get used to it, it&#8217;s hard to go back. <\/p>\n<p>Static types allow better documentation which in turn gives better tooling. Allows jumping around points in code easier. <\/p>\n<p>Types are optional. Don&#8217;t need to have types everywhere. Kinda like code coverage. Do what you need. <\/p>\n<p>Now showing demos. There&#8217;s a plugin available for sublime which helps writing Typescript easier. Now urging audience to find bugs in presented demo code. Interfaces help debug code as it sets expectations for assignable types. <\/p>\n<p>Live stack trace. Bugs and trace disappears as you fix them. How cool is that? <\/p>\n<p>Debugging in this thing is amazing. Errors are helpful and intellisense is better as the code knows things! <\/p>\n<p>A variable can have more than one type. Like string or a string array. In this case, the Typescript expects common methods in both types to be valid. If specific methods needs to be used then need to cast or parse it. <\/p>\n<p>Generics! <\/p>\n<p>\u201cthis demo has blown my mind.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now showing a demo with angular.<\/p>\n<p>Imports works dynamically with node modules. It just works! <\/p>\n<p>Urging developers to start distributing Typescript files along with their modules. <\/p>\n<p>Decorators are able to interfere with the declaration of an object. Logger decorator injects function before execution of the target function. <\/p>\n<p>Reflection API. Decorators don&#8217;t modify the object but adds metadata using the reflection API. <\/p>\n<p>Reflect.getmetadata(\u201cannotations\u201d, varname) <\/p>\n<p>Embed html code directly in javascript in jsx files.

A bunch of practices that act as a safe net against failure.\n\nOf all the practices, going to talk about pairing, test first and continuous delivery.\n\nStarting with pair programming. Similar to Pacific Rim.\n\nAll production code is developed by more than one person. When pairing, design decisions are discussed between pairs.\n\nTwo roles, navigator and worker. Switch pairs everyday to make sure that everybody is exposed to the code. Everyone is responsible for how the code works.\n\nMake best use of the team expertise. Use everybody\u2019s skills to the fullest and enable cross functional skills share. Allows sanity checking of ideas, avoiding rabbit holes.\n\nTaking pair programming to more extreme level. Mob programming. Taking the driver and navigator idea to a team. Whole team sits around a screen with one person with the keyboard.\n\nDriver types while team navigates. Run a timer to switch roles in and out. Kinda like coding dojo but do it in an open workspace. 3 or 4 people works the best. Fits nicely into size of ideal agile teams.\n\nThis means that if one of the person has to go to the meeting the work continues.\n\nUse spikes. Spikes are done solo. Mob might split up and then do spike of their own. Each spike is an investigation. Prove out an architecture or a design idea and then bring it in and explain it to the team. Code produced is thrown away. This is done to maintain code quality and not use something that was developed in a rush.\n\nDon\u2019t use code reviews. The process causes a longer delay between creation and release. Also causes bottleneck. Pair \/ mob programming removes the need of this.\n\nNow talking about Test First.\n\nGives confidence to deploy and refactor. Avoid manual mistakes. Keeps focus on what we are building now instead of other distractions on what it might be in future.\n\nCreate acceptance test first. Helps focus implementation. Make sure we only build what we need. Helps us with continuous delivery.\n\nNow talking about continuous delivery.\n\nDeploy several times a day. From implementation to live in a couple of hours. Keep development pipeline short.\n\nUse extensive monitoring to help track impact of releases. Measure various metrics, from hard metrics like CPU monitoring to actual speed of responses.\n\nAlways committing to master. Avoid problems by decouple releases from development. Code is always released but use feature toggles to turn new features on or off. Settings based on environments.\n\nToggles don\u2019t stay for forever. Once it\u2019s production ready and proven, it gets taken off and it\u2019s permanently on.\n\nUse mutex for deployments instead of ci pipeline. Use deployment tokens like a teddy bear to allow teams to deploy to production.\n\nNow top 3 tips even if you\u2019re not in extreme programming\n\n1. Add monitoring.  \n Use it even if you\u2019re not using continuous delivery. Even if code is not changed, the environment might change. Start with generic health check and then proceed to what you need.\n\n2. Test first bug fix.  \n Diagnose the issue and the \u00a0reproduce the steps. Once done, write a test that reproduces the issue.\n\n3. Pair code reviews  \n Review code while pairing. Eliminate bottlenecks.\n\nAdd practices from XP incrementally and see what works for you.\n\nTech.unruly.co\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_125\">[](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F10%2F20%2Fnotes-from-extreme-programming-in-a-nutshell-at-angular-connect-2015%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20Extreme%20Programming%20in%20a%20nutshell%20at%20Angular%20Connect%202015 \"Evernote\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F10%2F20%2Fnotes-from-extreme-programming-in-a-nutshell-at-angular-connect-2015%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20Extreme%20Programming%20in%20a%20nutshell%20at%20Angular%20Connect%202015 \"Facebook\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F10%2F20%2Fnotes-from-extreme-programming-in-a-nutshell-at-angular-connect-2015%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20Extreme%20Programming%20in%20a%20nutshell%20at%20Angular%20Connect%202015 \"Twitter\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F10%2F20%2Fnotes-from-extreme-programming-in-a-nutshell-at-angular-connect-2015%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20Extreme%20Programming%20in%20a%20nutshell%20at%20Angular%20Connect%202015 \"Google+\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2015%2F10%2F20%2Fnotes-from-extreme-programming-in-a-nutshell-at-angular-connect-2015%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20Extreme%20Programming%20in%20a%20nutshell%20at%20Angular%20Connect%202015 \"LinkedIn\") [](https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share)<\/div><\/div>\n","html":"<p>13:30<\/p>\n<p>Day one<\/p>\n<p>Extreme programming in a nutshell. <\/p>\n<p>Extreme programming has practices that keep you safe.

Easy control of Phillips hue lights. Maps the person with the remote into a 3D space. Could potentially be used for indoor navigation?  \n Point the device at any smart bulb or device and instantly control it.  \n Quite expensive. \u20ac200 to produce the remote.\n\n\n## Mainframe\n\nContext sensitive instant messaging with backwards compatibility to email. AI that goes through your email\/messages looking for actions. Based on content and context, it converts them to tasks\/calendar events\/reminders. Pretty cool. Also does same thing for incoming email messages, which means that incoming email acts as an instant message. When sending instant message, if recipient is an email, it creates action links which allows the recipient to integrate with the system.\n\n\n## Max\n\nSA startup. Delivery provider in Lagos. Allows delivery in 3 hours. Drivers drive motorbikes to escape traffic. Customer website allows booking of deliveries with ease. Have launched APIs and are helping retailers integrate their platform with them. The delivery guys are also being trained to be sales agents. They pitch their product, increase awareness.\n\n\n## YayPay\n\nAccounts receivable office for every small business. Setup invoice on YayPay. Client gets the invoice and can pay using various pay,net methods. Also allows clients to pay a deposit. Allows sending up a collection process, like sending an email two weeks before due date, SMS reminders two days before, call after a week after due date and then emails every two weeks. Uses machine learning to determine best payment method.\n\n\n## FairFleet\n\nMunich, Germany. Inspect your construction site using drones. Crowd sourcing model. Choose the construction site you want to get inspected. Mark area of inspection. Set accuracy. Get accurate photos daily. Go back in timeline to inspect progress. Uses MapBox API for geo mapping.\n\n\n## JukeDeck (winner of the startup battlefield)\n\nArtificially intelligent music player. Have build software that composes original music note by note. Google and the royal family have used their music. Choose the length, mood, style and it creates music from scratch. Most awesome demo with live rap.\n\n\n## Move bubble\n\nConsumer property app. Property feed. Learns with use. Allows setting up appointments with property owners.\n\n\n## Yoobic\n\nApps for helping sales employees work better with sales management team. App allows publishing of goals and missions that can be delivered wirelessly to various stores. Sales employees of their stores will get notified of available mission. App can also be used for inventory management (sort of). Analytics for viewing various metrics like sales percentages for various products etc. Claims can increase sales by 25%. Collaboration platform for brands and retailers.\n\n\n## Caruma\n\nA device with two cameras, front and back, 4G, and wifi hotspot. Provides security to prevent theft. Uses motion and face detection to check if something is wrong. Sounds alarm even if the driver is dozing off. Live video recording and upload capabilities. Comes with the app that notifies when something\u2019s wrong with the car.\n\n\n# Day two\n\n\n## Fireside chat with CEO of Twilio\n\nJeff Lawson. Used to work at Amazon web services. Observed that communications is key when building a customer centric business. In those times, comms costed a lot and required a lot of hardware infrastructure. Set out to create Twilio to make software driven communications that can be setup in matter of minutes. Strongly believes that the ability to experiment stuff very quickly is key to innovation and hence has built a business that allows developers to do exactly that.\n\n\n## Chat with Hassle.com\n\nAlex Depledge. Website to get house cleaners on demand. It is important to be naive when moving into a new industry. She was able to make such an impact in cleaning industry because she was naive. Lost a lot of money, down to \u00a3100 but kept pushing. She and her team coded all Christmas and launched the product in January and made more money in that month than all in last six months combined. Strongly believes in free market which allows movement of labour. Talks about gender equality. Started \u201cGirls can code\u201d movement and found that there are women in tech but they are just aren\u2019t recognised. Also, at the younger age, there is a serious lack of awareness about technology. For instance, girls didn\u2019t know what a UX developer was or what a full stack developer did in their day job.  \n Thinks that government legislation needs to be refactored. The laws that govern today\u2019s business have been created in old times, situation that is probably not relevant anymore. Worse thing than refactoring code is writing more and more code on top of old code.\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_131\">[](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F01%2F10%2Fnotes-from-techcrunch-disrupt-london-2015%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20TechCrunch%20Disrupt%20London%202015 \"Evernote\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F01%2F10%2Fnotes-from-techcrunch-disrupt-london-2015%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20TechCrunch%20Disrupt%20London%202015 \"Facebook\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F01%2F10%2Fnotes-from-techcrunch-disrupt-london-2015%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20TechCrunch%20Disrupt%20London%202015 \"Twitter\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F01%2F10%2Fnotes-from-techcrunch-disrupt-london-2015%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20TechCrunch%20Disrupt%20London%202015 \"Google+\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F01%2F10%2Fnotes-from-techcrunch-disrupt-london-2015%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20TechCrunch%20Disrupt%20London%202015 \"LinkedIn\") [](https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share)<\/div><\/div>\n","html":"<h1><a href=\"https:\/\/www.manthanhd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/TC2015-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-275\" src=\"https:\/\/www.manthanhd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/TC2015-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"TC2015 1\" width=\"696\" height=\"522\" \/><\/a><\/h1>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Day One<\/h1>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sevenhugs remote<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">EU startup.

It has been primarily like this since I\u2019ve been busy doing what I always do \u2013 trying out new cool things and ideas.\n\nIn almost every app, every SaaS platform or every web based backend system I write, the first thing I start with is an API. This API first attitude has helped me in many ways. First and foremost, it helps me think how the architecture must work to suffice the needs of the client. It also leads me to think about containers and how best to distribute load etc. Now, this might seem like an overkill when just trying out a new idea but it at least gives me a rough estimate of the scope of the project that I\u2019m looking at. Besides, now a days, working with thick client frameworks like Angular JS almost demands that you have a strong backend with a well written collection of APIs.\n\nWriting restful APIs time and time again have helped me improve my understanding regarding the idea of \u201crestful APIs\u201d with every iteration and hence, I\u2019ve come up with few thoughts regarding ways in which a RESTful API should be written. So, here we go.\n\n**A URL path should contain singular nouns and nothing else. **This comes straight out of the REST specification. However, there have been cases where I have been forced to use verbs but that has only been the case when I haven\u2019t been very clear about what that endpoint is doing. Before defining your endpoints, be very clear on what you are trying to achieve. For instance, once I was writing an endpoint for an application to process an incoming web hook. Hence, I named the endpoint \u201cPOST: \/process\u201d. While I actually did implement this, it kept bugging me throughout the implementation of the application. Finally, when that piece of functionality was coming to an end did I get crystal clear understanding regarding what that endpoint was doing. When a web hook gets triggered, things happen within the application. THAT thing is an Event! Without doubt, I quickly renamed the endpoint to \u201cPOST: \/event\u201d and my mind was at peace. In retrospect, I think I should\u2019ve created a separate endpoint for each application consuming that endpoint.\n\nWhile developing one of the APIs, I had a devious idea. Normally when defining an endpoint that allows one to retrieve a resource, say for instance a post object, one\u2019s target endpoint might look like \u201cGET: \/post\/1\u201d where \u201cpost\u201d is the resource and \u201c1\u201d is the ID of the resource. But what if I wanted to select posts by their category ID? Would my target endpoint look like \u201cGET: \/post\/1\u201d? If yes then whats the difference between the first and second call? How about \u201cGET: \/post\/byCategory\/1\u201d? Or even \u201cGET: \/postsByCategory\/1\u201d?\n\nFor some time I had a crazy obsession with such endpoints to an extent that quite a few endpoints during that time were defined like this. However, after a while these endpoints just started to look weird. Also, when I started developing the frontend AngularJS application, making queries started to feel more difficult than it should\u2019ve been. For instance, I had a dropdown that allowed a user to select the search type (category|tags|name) and then whatever the user typed in the search box got searched. Initially I had a horrible if|elseif|else blocks which chose which endpoint to call based on selected search type. However, this quickly became really boring, tedious and frankly, dirty. So, I revisited my endpoints again. If I, as someone who had made these endpoints struggled to develop an application using them, then what should I expect from the developers who will build their applications on my platform?\n\nFinally, I ended up having a couple of thoughts regarding how this should be done. \u201cGET: \/post?categoryId=5\u201d was my final answer. This not only solved the problem of querying by multiple search parameters but also made it easier for the consuming application to call the endpoint. Now, this new endpoint meant that I only had to assign field names to each dropdown and the query would build itself!\n\n**Query strings represent things that you want to do to your resource. **This is normally fairly obvious and I will cover more of this in depth in later paragraphs but for starters, query strings can be nouns, adjectives or even verbs (rare) with values or switches on them. For instance, \u201cGET: \/person\/1?gender=male\u201d clearly means that give me a person with ID 1 whose gender is male.\n\nYou can also do other neat things with query strings like provide metadata regarding your call. For instance, \u201cGET: \/person\/1?_select=firstname,lastname\u201d means give me person whose ID is 1 and only select firstname and lastname fields of each object. This kind of functionality is especially useful as it helps clients save their precious processing power, memory and network bandwidth. Think of small micro controllers displaying temperature information or mobile apps running on 2G or even Edge network. Any query parameter indicating metadata should begin with an underscore so that they can easily be differentiated in a pool of query parameters.\n\nNever ever build a query within a query. I saw some examples on the web where someone had built an endpoint like \u201cGET: \/post\/?query=startsWith:Senate,hasMinWords:100\u201d. I mean, why? How does one even go thinking like this? This is a horrible idea because you\u2019re forcing your users to learn your query language even when the principles you\u2019re building this on (REST) provides a framework like query string for you to use. The above query within query can be broken down as \u201cGET: \/post?startsWith=Senate&hasMinWords=100\u201d. This is perfectly acceptable.\n\nYou could ask, what if I wanted to search posts by their post header, body and tag components? Well, you could just do \u201cGET: \/post?headerStartsWith=Senate&bodyHasMinWords=100\u201d or even \u201cGET: \/post?header.startsWith=Senate&body.hasMinWords=100\u201d although the first one reads better but might be slightly tricky to implement.\n\n**Respond properly, don\u2019t be lazy. **When it comes to responses, it\u2019s easy to forget how important it is to respond properly. In most of the APIs that I write, for every POST request, I like to respond with HTTP 200 returning the object instance that was created as a result of that request. The same goes for PUT, but not for DELETE. The name of that HTTP method, DELETE clearly means that the resource was deleted, i.e. it doesn\u2019t exist. It makes me sad when I see implementations online where people return the resource that was deleted. If it was deleted what can the client possibly use it for? Hence, for DELETE, the response should be HTTP 204 no content.\n\nNow, depending on how secure you want to make your API, the behaviour of your endpoints on error will differ. It is incredibly useful to respond with a stack trace in a development environment but probably not when it comes to production. It pays in the long run to respond in a meaningful way when something goes wrong. At the very least, you must respond with HTTP 400 when it is the client\u2019s fault, for example validation of the input data gone wrong. However, there are tons of other error codes you could use for other situations.\n\nSometimes you might have a protected resource, something that requires a login. In situations such as these, there are two ways you can respond, 401 (Unauthorized) and 403 (Forbidden). Typically, I like to respond with 403 when user is not logged in, i.e. not authenticated and 401 when the user is authenticated but doesn\u2019t have enough privileges i.e. is not authorized to do that operation. Never ever redirect to login page or API endpoint when the client is trying to do something that requires login.\n\nThere is no shame in responding with HTTP 500. Yes you read that right. HTTP 500 does not mean that your app has crashed. It only means that something has gone wrong at the server side and the server doesn\u2019t want to tell you about it. Think about it. If the app had crashed, you wouldn\u2019t receive any response. It\u2019d just die. When writing any API during my first iteration, I just respond with 500s in all places where I think things might go wrong. I normally then go back and improve things one by one, handling errors carefully and responding in a helpful way.\n\nNow, a word on caching. As far as I know, most containers and frameworks handle caching internally. However, sometimes you might need to configure stuff at endpoint level. For instance, if your endpoint is outputting information that gets updated as part of a batch process that occurs infrequently, it will be incredibly useful to use the expires headers. Also, when responding to a request, if the if-modified-since header is indicating that the data that you have on the server hasn\u2019t changed since last time, respond with 304. This is incredibly useful especially when your client is a webapp running in a web browser as it will help improve client experience dramatically.\n\n**Login requests must always be a POST request. **I get this a lot. If you ask this to me a couple of years ago, I\u2019d probably say that the objective of Login is to \u201cget\u201d a session and hence it should be a GET request. I don\u2019t even know how I got that logic but one of my colleagues opened my eyes when they mentioned that the objective of Login is not to GET a login session but to CREATE one and hence it is a POST request. Same goes for registration. Your response at this stage depends. You could either respond with the user object which contains information about the logged in user or you can just return with 204. However, bear in mind that you\u2019ll have to strip out sensitive information like passwords and security question answers when responding with the user object to avoid security nightmare.\n\nHowever, for consumer facing applications, game has slightly changed with the introduction of social logins. In this case, you\u2019ll be making everyone\u2019s life easier if the initial request to login via social network was a GET request. As a general rule of thumb, I normally go with \u201cGET: \/auth\/<provider name>\u201d type of format when introducing social logins where in case of Facebook, this becomes \u201cGET: \/auth\/facebook\u201d.\n\nSo I hope this has given you something to think about. Let me know if you have any questions, comments or feedback. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this!\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_133\">[](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F01%2F11%2Fthe-restful-way-of-the-apis%2F&linkname=Some%20thoughts%20on%20the%20RESTful%20way%20of%20the%20APIs \"Evernote\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F01%2F11%2Fthe-restful-way-of-the-apis%2F&linkname=Some%20thoughts%20on%20the%20RESTful%20way%20of%20the%20APIs \"Facebook\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F01%2F11%2Fthe-restful-way-of-the-apis%2F&linkname=Some%20thoughts%20on%20the%20RESTful%20way%20of%20the%20APIs \"Twitter\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F01%2F11%2Fthe-restful-way-of-the-apis%2F&linkname=Some%20thoughts%20on%20the%20RESTful%20way%20of%20the%20APIs \"Google+\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F01%2F11%2Fthe-restful-way-of-the-apis%2F&linkname=Some%20thoughts%20on%20the%20RESTful%20way%20of%20the%20APIs \"LinkedIn\") [](https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share)<\/div><\/div>\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, it&#8217;s been a while now since I have written a post reflecting my thoughts on a subject.

If you searched for Express app generator, you\u2019ll probably find at least five in the first page of search results.\n\nIn my opinion, most of these are designed for hackathons \u2013 to get you up and running as fast as possible but also as crudely as possible. While they are good when you want to try something out quickly, most of that code will turn into a big pile of mess as your application grows.\n\nI\u2019ve been in this situation before. I get my application up and running as fast as possible and in order to get my first MVP done but then quickly realise that the auto generated code that was meant to accelerate my development is now slowing me down. To remedy this, this is now how I develop my node.js applications.\n\nJust a quick note. I still use the <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">\u2018express-generator<\/span>\u00a0\u2018 module for all my express applications.\n\nEvery <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">Route<\/span>\u00a0 file should have its own function. Consider this:\n\n\/\/ file: routes\/IndexRoute.js function IndexRoute(express) { var router = express.Router(); router.get('\/', function(req, res) { return res.render('index'); }); return router; } module.exports = IndexRoute;\n\nNow, implement this in <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">app.js<\/span>\u00a0 like so:\n\n\/\/ file: app.js var express = require('express'); ... var indexRoute = require('.\/routes\/IndexRoute')(express); ... app.use('\/', indexRoute);\n\nI quite like this approach because it keeps code clean and avoids having to use `require` everywhere. Also, by just looking at the module you can figure out what it depends on. For instance, here in <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">IndexRoute.js<\/span>\u00a0 file (above) you can tell that it depends on express. For more complicated modules that require additional dependencies you can keep adding them in the module function declaration. For example:\n\nfunction UserRoute(express, userModel, moment) { ... } module.exports = UserRoute;\n\nHere the <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline\">UserRoute<\/span>\u00a0clearly depends on express, <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline\">userModel<\/span>\u00a0(mongoose model) and moment (npm moment.js).\n\nSometimes when developing cool and awesome stuff, it is easy to get carried away. For instance, in the case above, the <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">UserRoute<\/span>\u00a0 is doing too much. It\u2019s doing something with time using moment and also manipulating user in the database using <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">userModel<\/span>\u00a0. While it\u2019s borderline fine (with massive cringe), you might want to think about what the <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline\">UserRoute <\/span>\u00a0should actually be doing.\n\nIn most cases, the way I group responsibilities is following.

If you searched for Express app generator, you&#8217;ll probably find at least five in the first page of search results.<\/p>\n<p>In my opinion, most of these are designed for hackathons &#8211; to get you up and running as fast as possible but also as crudely as possible. While they are good when you want to try something out quickly, most of that code will turn into a big pile of mess as your application grows.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been in this situation before. I get my application up and running as fast as possible and in order to get my first MVP done but then quickly realise that the auto generated code that was meant to accelerate my development is now slowing me down. To remedy this, this is now how I develop my node.js applications.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Just a quick note. I still use the <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">&#8216;express-generator<\/span>\u00a0&#8216; module for all my express applications.<\/p>\n<p>Every <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">Route<\/span>\u00a0 file should have its own function. Consider this:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"lang:js decode:true\">\/\/ file: routes\/IndexRoute.js \r\nfunction IndexRoute(express) {\r\n     var router = express.Router();\r\n     router.get('\/', function(req, res) {\r\n         return res.render('index');\r\n     });\r\n     return router;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = IndexRoute;<\/pre>\n<p>Now, implement this in <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">app.js<\/span>\u00a0 like so:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"lang:js decode:true \">\/\/ file: app.js \r\nvar express = require('express'); \r\n... \r\nvar indexRoute = require('.\/routes\/IndexRoute')(express); \r\n... \r\napp.use('\/', indexRoute);<\/pre>\n<p>I quite like this approach because it keeps code clean and avoids having to use <code>require<\/code> everywhere. Also, by just looking at the module you can figure out what it depends on. For instance, here in <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">IndexRoute.js<\/span>\u00a0 file (above) you can tell that it depends on express. For more complicated modules that require additional dependencies you can keep adding them in the module function declaration. For example:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"lang:js decode:true\">function UserRoute(express, userModel, moment) { \r\n... \r\n}\r\nmodule.exports = UserRoute;<\/pre>\n<p>Here the <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline\">UserRoute<\/span>\u00a0clearly depends on express, <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline\">userModel<\/span>\u00a0(mongoose model) and moment (npm moment.js).<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes when developing cool and awesome stuff, it is easy to get carried away. For instance, in the case above, the <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">UserRoute<\/span>\u00a0 is doing too much. It&#8217;s doing something with time using moment and also manipulating user in the database using <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">userModel<\/span>\u00a0. While it&#8217;s borderline fine (with massive cringe), you might want to think about what the <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline\">UserRoute <\/span>\u00a0should actually be doing.<\/p>\n<p>In most cases, the way I group responsibilities is following. Everything suffixed with <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">Route<\/span>\u00a0 manages Expressjs route mappings.

The CoP must respectfully accommodate individual thoughts and factor in thoughts of every participating individuals when making decision regarding a new idea or thought process.\n\nIf sufficient number of members are not present in the CoP to participate in the decision then the decision must be withheld until such people in required capacity are present. However, if required, due to a valid business reason, this can be overridden and an executive decision can be made with the number of members available at the time.\n\nIn such a case, the community (when members in sufficient capacity are present) has the right to question, criticise and challenge the decision that has been made. If the executive decision maker is unable to provide reasonable reason as to why the decision was made (why it was made in absence of sufficient community members as well), the community has the right to undo \/ repair the decision, even to full extent where possible.\n\nDepending on the size of the community, it may not be possible to accommodate everyone in every decision all the time as not all members might be able to make it to the community all the time. In such a case one of the two below techniques can be used to distribute power.\n\n### **Two Twins**\n\nEach community member elects his\/her counterpart. This is the person that they trust with their decision. Ideally, the counterpart must be unique i.e. if someone is already someone else\u2019s counterpart then they can not be elected a counterpart again. If this is happening frequently then you might want to see the \u201c[Executive Lead](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1247caF8ttr7N9yZLlNbFPTPkSyMDus4_itxt63IrOPQ\/edit#heading=h.wptbowy78vtk)\u201d approach. The counterpart must be someone they trust with a decision and ideally from a different team.\n\nThe idea of choosing the counterpart is that if someone isn\u2019t available at a time when a decision is made then the counterpart can speak on their behalf. This is why this person has to be someone they trust will make a sound judgement. This helps reduce number of people who need to be present when making a decision and also helps avoid people making executive decisions when sufficient number of people aren\u2019t available (as theoretically one person is representing two). This works best when members in the community are equal to or below 20.\n\n### **Executive Lead**\n\nDivide the total members of community by 7, round it down and the result is the number of executive leads the community needs. An executive lead is someone that everyone in the community is comfortable with and is trusting to make a sound decision. In community\u2019s absence a vote is still made within the executive leads but this helps reduce the number of people that need to be present.\n\nBeing an executive lead also comes with responsibility. He\/she is responsible for communicating a decision clearly to the community, along with the reasons if the decision has already been made. When participating in a decision, the executive lead must also think about the wider impact and not just impact in his\/her immediate vicinity (per se). The community has the right to demote an executive lead if sufficient number (see [impact sizes](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1247caF8ttr7N9yZLlNbFPTPkSyMDus4_itxt63IrOPQ\/edit#heading=h.kp8sz1p9yooi)) think that they\u2019ve had a negative or not much impact in the role.\n\nThe impact size agreement levels also apply to the executive leads. Unless the required number agree, the decision must not be made otherwise. Executive leads nullify the need of having to make an executive decision as they are the community representatives.\n\nDepending on size of the community and type of the organisation executive leads can have more responsibilities that help them justify the need for them to stay being an executive lead. This could range from empowering individuals beyond their potential to influencing the range of impact a particular community has.\n\nIdeally the community should cycle their executive leads once every couple of months, depending on cadence.\n\n\n## **Open**\n\nEvery decision that goes through the community must be communicated very clearly and in \u201cas is\u201d format. Any community member is encouraged to challenge the decision no matter how senior a person who has proposed\/made the decision is. For this, open forums, wiki pages and online chat (eg. slack) can be used.\n\nWhen an idea is presented, it must be sized according to its impact. This could work similarly to story points (range 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20). Breakdowns according to impact are as follows:\n\n### **Impact Size: 1, 3**\n\nLow impact. Eg. Someone proposing a minor non breaking change in a library that impacts a small project and future projects.\n\nNeeds agreement from 60% of the community.\n\n### **Impact Size: 8, 13**\n\nMedium impact. Eg. Someone proposing a major non breaking change\/feature in a library that may impact multiple existing projects and all future projects.\n\nNeeds agreement from 70% of the community.\n\n### **Impact Size: 20, 40**\n\nHigh Impact. Eg. Someone proposing a change in framework that is being used. This change impacts current projects and all future projects.\n\nNeeds agreement from at least 80% of the community.\n\n\n## **Well-managed**\n\nCommunity refines its own processes to make sure that they stay current with changing times. This can be achieved with a retrospective every once or twice a month (depending on cadence). Defect within a process should be raised like a normal issue or idea and discussed as such. The community as a whole has the power to improve, challenge, criticise and disagree with its own processes. These processes shouldn\u2019t be treated as a barrier but more like a malleable guideline that is in place to grow the community. If it is not being used in line with the ideology then the community is empowered to replace its processes with ones that it sees fit.\n\nThe goal of the community is to create a utopia where people can openly voice their ideas, share opinions and collectively improve the organisation as a whole.\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_143\">[](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F02%2F11%2Fdecision-making-framework-for-community-of-practices-draft-2%2F&linkname=Decision%20making%20framework%20for%20Community%20of%20Practices%20%28Draft%202%29 \"Evernote\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F02%2F11%2Fdecision-making-framework-for-community-of-practices-draft-2%2F&linkname=Decision%20making%20framework%20for%20Community%20of%20Practices%20%28Draft%202%29 \"Facebook\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F02%2F11%2Fdecision-making-framework-for-community-of-practices-draft-2%2F&linkname=Decision%20making%20framework%20for%20Community%20of%20Practices%20%28Draft%202%29 \"Twitter\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F02%2F11%2Fdecision-making-framework-for-community-of-practices-draft-2%2F&linkname=Decision%20making%20framework%20for%20Community%20of%20Practices%20%28Draft%202%29 \"Google+\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F02%2F11%2Fdecision-making-framework-for-community-of-practices-draft-2%2F&linkname=Decision%20making%20framework%20for%20Community%20of%20Practices%20%28Draft%202%29 \"LinkedIn\") [](https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share)<\/div><\/div>\n","html":"<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cEmpowering, open and well-managed\u201d<\/h1>\n<h2><strong>Empowering<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Everyone in the CoP and outside CoP must be able to demonstrate idea, opinions and thoughts.

Contrasting old way of retrieving things using the AWS SDK with the new way, it looks like they have switched from SOAP API to a RESTful API. The old way requires you to create Request and Response objects every time you want to do anything with the AWS API. Looking into the implementation, this looks a lot like SOAP.\n\nThe new way is a lot more neater. A request can be built using builders that work on a conceptual model of the request. Response is also a lot more conceptual and easy to read.\n\n### Signing requests with your credentials\n\nSignature prevents the request from being tampered as the signature will become invalid as soon as someone changes the request in transit. It is also time based so that the replay attacks can be prevented.\n\nSDK signs requests automatically so normally no manual intervention is required.\n\n\n## SDKs\n\nRegarding regions, when instantiating the service client, a region must be set. In all languages, except Java, if a region isn\u2019t specified, it will go and find the region specified in .aws\/credentials file under [default].\n\nExceptions are of two types in Java and .Net: AmazonServiceException is exception coming from the service itself, I.e. Remote. AmazonClientException is an exception happening on the client side due to bad request. This is slightly different in JavaScript due to callbacks. Here, callbacks are always in function(error, data) format.\n\nSDK will retry most requests that fail except ones that have service errors like access denied etc.\n\nA set of client credentials won\u2019t be locked out unless all the requests that are coming in look like an attack.\n\n\n## AWS Data Storage\n\nS3, Glacier, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, RDS, RedShift.\n\nEvery byte you change will need a reupload of the whole file. Not good for data that is changing constantly. Use S3 if you want your data to be read a lot more than changed. Highly scalable and durable. Allows hosting of static websites. Two plans: S3 Standard and S3 Standard \u2013 Infrequent Access.\n\nUse Glacier for files that you want to keep for long time. Archival solution, cheap long term storage. Retrieval is slow, about 3-5 hours to process a file retrieval. Old backups, auditing data, log files for keep sake should go in Glacier. Create a job in S3 that moves a file that hasn\u2019t been read in one or two months to Glacier and then another policy that deletes old data after 3-5 years from Glacier.\n\nDynamoDB NoSQL Key Value pair solution. For data that\u2019s not too complex or relational or transactional. Scales horizontally as per need.\n\nRDS is traditional relational database. Use for transactional or relational data. Scales horizontally with automatic failover to secondary instances. Allows variety of engines like Amazon Aurora, Oracle, MS SQL Server, Postgres, MySQL etc.\n\nElastiCache caching solution. Store lightweight short lived data. Blazing fast retrieval. Allows creation and scale cache cluster. Based on memcache and redis.\n\nRedShift allows complex queries on massive data sets (petabyte scale). Data warehousing solution. Massively parallel model. Takes your query, compiles it and runs it in parallel across a large number of instances. Customers could take their load balancer logs, put them into RedShift and then compile list of customers and their frequency including their country of origin. RedShift provides JDBC and ODBC drivers to enable you to use familiar SQL client tools.\n\n\n## Developing storage solutions with Amazon S3\n\nData is stored in S3 buckets as objects. The bucket names must be globally unique. Bucket names: 3-63 chars, lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens and no periods.\n\nWhen storing files\/objects in a bucket, prefer to use the path structure for file names so that rules can be created easily. Paths actually has no meaning to S3 but it\u2019s useful for us as it enables rule creation.\n\nFor retrieval, use path style https:\/\/<region specific endpoint>\/<bucket name>\/<object name> or virtual hosted style http:\/\/<bucket name>.s3.amazonaws.com\/<object name>.\n\nWhile uploading files, if the file size is > 100MB, use multi-part upload. Usually this rule is for files that are > 5GB.\n\nWhile reading, you can read the entire file or only read a specific range of bytes.\n\nWhile deleting, if versioning is enabled, on delete it will revert to the previous version if it exists. However, if versioning is not enabled then the file is permanently deleted. For objects or buckets backed up to glacier, they can be restored back at any time.\n\nPre-signed URLs allows one to provide access to someone to upload or download a file to bucket to\/from S3. Pre-signed URLs expire after a specific time period. This period by default is \u2026.\n\nSSL-encrypted end points allow security of data in transit.\n\nS3 allows CORS to be specified. Add domains to it so that browser requests are allowed. Ex. Allow [www.capitalone.com](http:\/\/www.capitalone.com) to access fonts bucket.\n\nFor high performance, randomise part at the beginning of the key. This is because of the way S3 hashes URLs. If the beginning part is the same, all files end up on the same partition which will create bottleneck.\n\nAvoid unnecessary requests. S3 doesn\u2019t return back 304 for subsequent requests, it will always serve the file. Use a CDN instead.\n\nVerbose logging is allowed for S3. Use this only in development, and not on production system. Every HTTP request generates a request ID pair in logs. Reference this request ID when contacting AWS support.\n\n\n## Storing data using DynamoDB\n\nCan store JSON documents but these must be looked up by the key only.\n\nCommon use cases: Gaming, AdTech, Mobile apps, IoT. Send small data with very high frequency eg. Analytics. Record size must be less than 400KB. Each table has a key attribute which is the partition key. The partition key is hashed and then the data is put in that partition. Hence similar data must have same\/similar partition key.\n\nSort key is optional. For example, date of the transaction can be the sort key. This is the key that can be used for secondary lookup. For instance, if partition key is A and sort key is B, when doing lookup by A, it will return all data matching partition key A. However, we can narrow the search by looking up by partition key A and sort key B.\n\nDynamoDB is eventually consistent, usually within a second of the operation. Request can specify strong consistency but that means data might take longer to write and will cost more. Default is eventual consistency.\n\nRead capacity is reads per second of items up to 4 KB in size. Write capacity unit is in number of 1 KB writes per second.\n\nImportant to choose the right partition key as it directly affects the throughput. The total throughput is divided across partitions so if a set of partition keys are being looked up more often than others Then it means that the partition key must be fixed or changed.\n\nThe secondary index can be changed from the default.\n\nStreams allow firing of events based on an event. For instance, if user Jane changes her exercise from Walking to Spinning, then an update event is fired to all other systems notifying them of the change. Works much like Kinesis streams.\n\nValues can be retrieved matching a specific primary key condition. THis can be refined by providing a filter expression. If the data is looked up by a field that is not index, a scan operation will happen which is much slower than index lookup as it has to scan through the entire database looking for the record.\n\nPagination: returns up to 1 MB of data or limit by number of items to be returned, like 2 records.\n\nQuery can return many items, getItem returns a specific item by key. PutItem adds a new item. UpdateItem updates a specific item. RemoveItem means removing a specific attribute from an item while DeleteItem deletes a whole item. AddItem adds an attribute to an item.\n\nWrites provide free reads as the written value is returned when it\u2019s written. Write operations can be made conditional. For instance perform write operation only when account lock timeout has passed.\n\nIn Java and .NET there\u2019s a persistence model available. This allows the client to do client side operations.\n\nDynamoDB local is a client side application that mimics DynamoDB service. Can be used for testing applications before production and avoid additional cost.\n\nAlso comes with access management to control access to resources and actions.\n\n\n## Best practice\n\nMake sure that there are no hot (overused) partitions. Caching can help relieve this but ideally design partition keys so that this doesn\u2019t happen in first place.\n\nSeparate data that is not used very frequently on a different partitions and then adjust throughout. For instance, latest data can go on a high throughput partitions and old data is moved to one of the older partitions with lower throughput.\n\nUse one to many tables instead of one table with large number of attributes. This is more scalable. Store frequently accessed small attributes in a separate table. Example separate company stock table from company details as the stock table will have information updated and read more frequently than details.\n\nMax size for value is 400KB, can store binary.\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_145\">[](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-one%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20One%29 \"Evernote\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-one%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20One%29 \"Facebook\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-one%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20One%29 \"Twitter\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-one%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20One%29 \"Google+\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-one%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20One%29 \"LinkedIn\") [](https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share)<\/div><\/div>\n","html":"<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Basics<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Service client API has objects for request and response data.

Use for transactional or relational data. Scales horizontally with automatic failover to secondary instances. Allows variety of engines like Amazon Aurora, Oracle, MS SQL Server, Postgres, MySQL etc.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ElastiCache caching solution. Store lightweight short lived data. Blazing fast retrieval. Allows creation and scale cache cluster. Based on memcache and redis.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RedShift allows complex queries on massive data sets (petabyte scale). Data warehousing solution. Massively parallel model. Takes your query, compiles it and runs it in parallel across a large number of instances. Customers could take their load balancer logs, put them into RedShift and then compile list of customers and their frequency including their country of origin. RedShift provides JDBC and ODBC drivers to enable you to use familiar SQL client tools.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Developing storage solutions with Amazon S3<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Data is stored in S3 buckets as objects. The bucket names must be globally unique. Bucket names: 3-63 chars, lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens and no periods.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When storing files\/objects in a bucket, prefer to use the path structure for file names so that rules can be created easily. Paths actually has no meaning to S3 but it&#8217;s useful for us as it enables rule creation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For retrieval, use path style https:\/\/&lt;region specific endpoint&gt;\/&lt;bucket name&gt;\/&lt;object name&gt; or virtual hosted style http:\/\/&lt;bucket name&gt;.s3.amazonaws.com\/&lt;object name&gt;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While uploading files, if the file size is &gt; 100MB, use multi-part upload. Usually this rule is for files that are &gt; 5GB.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While reading, you can read the entire file or only read a specific range of bytes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While deleting, if versioning is enabled, on delete it will revert to the previous version if it exists. However, if versioning is not enabled then the file is permanently deleted. For objects or buckets backed up to glacier, they can be restored back at any time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pre-signed URLs allows one to provide access to someone to upload or download a file to bucket to\/from S3. Pre-signed URLs expire after a specific time period. This period by default is \u2026.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SSL-encrypted end points allow security of data in transit.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">S3 allows CORS to be specified. Add domains to it so that browser requests are allowed. Ex. Allow <a href=\"http:\/\/www.capitalone.com\">www.capitalone.com<\/a> to access fonts bucket.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For high performance, randomise part at the beginning of the key. This is because of the way S3 hashes URLs. If the beginning part is the same, all files end up on the same partition which will create bottleneck.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Avoid unnecessary requests. S3 doesn&#8217;t return back 304 for subsequent requests, it will always serve the file. Use a CDN instead.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Verbose logging is allowed for S3. Use this only in development, and not on production system. Every HTTP request generates a request ID pair in logs. Reference this request ID when contacting AWS support.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Storing data using DynamoDB<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Can store JSON documents but these must be looked up by the key only.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Common use cases: Gaming, AdTech, Mobile apps, IoT. Send small data with very high frequency eg. Analytics. Record size must be less than 400KB. Each table has a key attribute which is the partition key. The partition key is hashed and then the data is put in that partition. Hence similar data must have same\/similar partition key.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sort key is optional. For example, date of the transaction can be the sort key. This is the key that can be used for secondary lookup. For instance, if partition key is A and sort key is B, when doing lookup by A, it will return all data matching partition key A. However, we can narrow the search by looking up by partition key A and sort key B.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">DynamoDB is eventually consistent, usually within a second of the operation. Request can specify strong consistency but that means data might take longer to write and will cost more. Default is eventual consistency.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Read capacity is reads per second of items up to 4 KB in size. Write capacity unit is in number of 1 KB writes per second.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Important to choose the right partition key as it directly affects the throughput. The total throughput is divided across partitions so if a set of partition keys are being looked up more often than others Then it means that the partition key must be fixed or changed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The secondary index can be changed from the default.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Streams allow firing of events based on an event. For instance, if user Jane changes her exercise from Walking to Spinning, then an update event is fired to all other systems notifying them of the change. Works much like Kinesis streams.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Values can be retrieved matching a specific primary key condition. THis can be refined by providing a filter expression. If the data is looked up by a field that is not index, a scan operation will happen which is much slower than index lookup as it has to scan through the entire database looking for the record.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pagination: returns up to 1 MB of data or limit by number of items to be returned, like 2 records.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Query can return many items, getItem returns a specific item by key. PutItem adds a new item. UpdateItem updates a specific item. RemoveItem means removing a specific attribute from an item while DeleteItem deletes a whole item. AddItem adds an attribute to an item.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Writes provide free reads as the written value is returned when it&#8217;s written. Write operations can be made conditional. For instance perform write operation only when account lock timeout has passed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Java and .NET there&#8217;s a persistence model available. This allows the client to do client side operations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">DynamoDB local is a client side application that mimics DynamoDB service. Can be used for testing applications before production and avoid additional cost.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also comes with access management to control access to resources and actions.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Best practice<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Make sure that there are no hot (overused) partitions. Caching can help relieve this but ideally design partition keys so that this doesn&#8217;t happen in first place.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Separate data that is not used very frequently on a different partitions and then adjust throughout. For instance, latest data can go on a high throughput partitions and old data is moved to one of the older partitions with lower throughput.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use one to many tables instead of one table with large number of attributes. This is more scalable. Store frequently accessed small attributes in a separate table. Example separate company stock table from company details as the stock table will have information updated and read more frequently than details.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Max size for value is 400KB, can store binary.<\/p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_146\"><a class=\"a2a_button_evernote\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-one%2F&amp;linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20One%29\" title=\"Evernote\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-one%2F&amp;linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20One%29\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-one%2F&amp;linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20One%29\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-one%2F&amp;linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20One%29\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-one%2F&amp;linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20One%29\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share\"><\/a><\/div><\/div>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Wed, 02 Mar 2016 22:17:34 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 02 Mar 2016 22:21:27 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 02 Mar 2016 22:17:34 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":340,"title":"Notes from AWS Developer Training (Day Two)","slug":"notes-from-aws-developer-training-day-two","markdown":"\n\n## Achieving loose coupling with Events\n\nAmazon SQS, SNS, DynamoDB Streams, Kinesis Streams, Lambda.\n\nWith the event driven architecture, two systems don\u2019t need to know about each other. Each of them can fire events while the other responds to that specific event.\n\nSNS has publish\/subscribe model. When publisher pushes, all subscribers immediately get the message. This can be email, SMS, SQS, Lambda etc.\n\nSQS queuing for delivery method. Messages are persisted until they are polled. Extremely scalable. Can potentially contain millions of messages.\n\nSNS and SQS can be used together. SNS delivers to the SQS queues each for one EC2 instance who then carry out a specific task. On push, SQS provides no guarantee for ordering.\n\nDynamoDB streams allow firing of events in a stream. For example, on image upload, the image is sent to S3 and the metadata is stored in DynamoDB. When the metadata is stored, DynamoDB fires off event in a stream which is read by Lambda. This can then do some computation around the data coming from DynamoDB.\n\nAmazon Kinesis Streams is a fully managed streaming data service. Helps aggregate data. Data stored in a Kinesis stream is ordered. Client can read a small segment from the stream. Allows adding of checkpoints so that if the client that is reading from a stream fails, it can continue from the last checkpoint.\n\nLambda is a event handler. Not a replacement but a variation of event driven server less code.\n\n\n## Kinesis\n\nOffers services to load and process large amounts of data. Allows building of streaming data applications.\n\nFirst thing that is to be created in Kinesis is a stream. Data records are put into the stream which are then read out from the other side. Stream has shards. Each shard has 1 MBPS write and 100 MBPS. Reads 5 transactions per second and writes are 1000 records per second. Shards can be merged afterwards if they are not in use. This action is reversible.\n\nEach data record has three parts. Sequence number (automatically created), partition key and then the data to be streamed. Data can be JSON\/XML\/Binary etc. The partition key determines which shard gets the data.\n\nOperations on stream: Create\/List\/Delete. Operations on shard: Retrieve\/Reshard (increase or merge shard count)\/Change data retention period. Every data record has its own expiration time.\n\nWhen data is inserted, the sequence number is automatically assigned and based on the partition key hash it is put in a shard that it selects.\n\nKPL (Kinesis Producer Library) acts as an intermediary between producer and a stream, Kinda transactional in the sense that when asked to insert multiple records, if one of them fails insert due to an issue (eg throughput) it denies request. However, the application can still choose to insert a value regardless of other values failing insert.\n\nKCL (Kinesis Consumer Library) is used by consumers to read\/consume values from the shards. Consumers can read from the beginning of the stream\/latest\/specific part of a stream based on the sequence number. The GetRecordsAPI requires an iterator.\n\nIf the data is being read from the tip of the stream, start the consumers first and then the producers otherwise the consumers won\u2019t read beginning of the data.\n\nWhen storing data randomise partition keys to make sure of even distribution of data between shards. Provision few extra shards to handle unexpected demands. More shards are needed to support several consumers simultaneously reading from a stream.\n\nBatch data before writes for efficiency. On throughput exceeded error, retry\/log and monitor\/reshard shards. Increase DynamoDB table throughput in extreme cases. Best to have DynamoDB handle duplicates as two records with same keys will be an overwrite.\n\nCheck permissions to make sure that the code has access to Amazon Kinesis streams, DynamoDB and CloudWatch services.\n\nHandle exceptions in processRecords method of IRecordProcessor object.\n\n\n## Amazon Simple Work Flow (SWF)\n\nAutomate flow of events. Could also have long running human tasks. For instance, have a workflow to create and email an invoice and then wait for someone to click approve link within the email to then resume the workflow to further dispatch the product.\n\nTwo types of work flow tasks: worker and decider. Decider can have code running behind it. Whatever thing the decider touches, it must have permission to access it. For instance, a decider to read from DynamoDB must have access to read data from DynamoDB. As the name suggests, the decider decides outcome. In the invoicing system, if the user clicks reject button in the invoice email, the decider can then cancel the order but continue with dispatch if the user clicks approve button.\n\nWhen the workflow starts the first time, SWF calls the decider which decides which step to go next. The control is then handed back to SWF from the decider and then based on the outcome of decider, SWF then goes to that step. The tasks that are executed can be executed asynchronously.\n\nNo visual way to create the work flows out of the box. Requires programmatic creation via SDK.\n\n\n## Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)\n\nAt least once delivery. Does not have all features of a fully fledged queuing solution. Highly scalable.\n\nProvides dead letter queues for messages that haven\u2019t been delivered.\n\nDistributed nature means that some messages may not be available across all SQS servers.\n\nMessage can appear in the queue after some time specified in delay seconds. Queue can restrict size of messages being put by specifying MaximumMessageSize. MessageRetentionPeriod specifies how long should a message be kept in the queue. This can be up to 14 days.\n\nWhile receiving messages, one can use short polling or long polling. Short polling means that SQS returns messages in short bursts (couple at a time), however, with Long polling, it blocks you until it finds significant number of messages. The block time is specified by the client, could be 5-10 seconds. Use this if processing large number of messages in batch is easier than in small batches.\n\nVisibility timeout is the time in which the message is invisible for a certain time and then becomes visible. This is for systems that need more time before they can pick up a message. The message handle can be used to extend this timeout if more time is needed.\n\nIn Java, client side buffering is allowed where the messages can be pre fetched into a local buffer. Automatically batches messages for send or delete operations.\n\nQueues can be shared to another AWS accounts with or without credentials (anonymously). Admin can also create policies that grant access to a specific queue. This can then be assigned to a role.\n\nRequests incoming to a queue cannot be directly throttled. So if a queue is shared with someone else, they could potentially DDoS the queue and have you charged for each request which could be disastrous. However, this can be implicitly controlled by giving someone access to an Amazon API Gateway endpoint which then throttles all requests from there on to the SQS.\n\n\n## Simple Notification Service (SNS)\n\nPub-sub model. Messages are sent to the SNS which then propagates them down to different services or applications. SNS messages are not persisted while SQS messages are. Also, interaction with SNS is passive (push) while the one with SQS is active (poll). Also, usually in SNS, one publisher talks to multiple consumers while SQS is usually meant for one publisher talking to one subscriber.\n\nMassively useful in decoupling applications. Supports event driven architecture where based on the message, the receivers could each do different things. For instance when an invoice is placed in SNS, one system that is subscribed could process the order associated with the invoice while second system could send email confirming the receipt of the order.\n\nSNS provides good fan out for massively parallel tasks. Example, lambda can listen for SNS messages, do the processing and then push to S3.\n\nDoes not batch messages. Every notification is a message. Does not guarantee ordering of messages. SNS Delivery policy, that applies to HTTP subscribers can be used to control retries in case of message delivery failure. Messages can contain up to 256KB of data.\n\nMessage sizes or format can be controlled using the message structure attribute of the message. For instance, in case of SMS message, the characters can be restricted to 160 characters. Refer to the documentation on the AWS website.\n\nUse cloud watch to keep track of stats about SNS.\n\n\n## Lambda\n\nCompute service similar to EC2. Automatically manages compute resources. Requires zero administration. Supports Python, Java (v8) and Node.js. Lets people focus on code, not administration. Removes need to have a lot of servers for a simple task. Hooks very well into Amazon AWS services. Known as connective tissue for AWS services. Eg. Fetch a file when it\u2019s uploaded to S3, do something with it and then send a SNS push notification with the resulting output of data.\n\nOnce created, lambda function can be invoked by:\n\n1. Push model by publishing an event.\n2. Pull model by watching a stream or source (Kinesis stream or SQS queue polls)\n3. Synchronous invocation by calling a function or API directly from Lambda.\n\n### Push event model\n\nEvent source must itself invoke a lambda function directly. From Amazon Echo, S3, SNS or Cognito. Example: User pushes an item to S3. S3 then pushes an event to Lambda which then assumes an execution role to process the file and upload the processed file back to lambda.\n\n### Pull model\n\nLambda polls the event service and then on event does things. For example polling a DynamoDB or Kinesis stream. The polling does not affect the cost associated with making requests. Upon event detection, it assumes Execution role and processes the event.\n\n### Synchronous model\n\nInvoke function in lambda using RequestResposne invocation type. Function executes and then returns immediately.\n\nWhen granting permissions, the source of the event must have permission to execute lambda functions. Whatever lambda then does must be able to execute operations that it is trying to do. For example, s3 upload event must have access to execute lambda. Then if the lambda function is uploading records to DynamoDB, it should have access to insert a DynamoDB record.\n\nIf the role isn\u2019t specified, it assumes basic lambda role. The basic role has the least privilege of being able to write a log file.\n\nWhen writing a function, choose the amount of memory that you want to allocate. It then allocates CPU power. Additional memory can be configured in 64 MB increments upto 1536 MB. All calls are limited to five minutes of execution time. The default timeout is 3 seconds but can be set to any value between 1 and 300ms. Duration is calculated to nearest 100 milliseconds.\n\nLambda functions be scheduled for execution. For example, get MI data every hour. Schedule can be set for fixed rate at every hour or 15 minutes. A crown expression can be provided.\n\nPackages for lambda functions can go up to 50 MB in size.\n\nFormat for specifying handler for a Java application is <package name>.<class name>::<function name>\n\nFunctions take longer to execute the first time because it creates a new container and allocates resources to it. However its faster from there on.\n\nVery easy integration with AWS API gateway where based on a request, a lambda function can be executed. The incoming request parameters can be mapped to lambda function parameters using a mapping template. For incoming JSON data, the mapping template allows mapping using json path.\n\nSounds like TDD is the best practice for writing lambda functions. All the functions should be strictly tested before publishing them.\n\nWhen subsequent updates are pushed to a lambda function, it automatically versions them. It allows reverting back to an old version if the latest is broken. One can also specify a specific version to lambda to execute. One can also define aliases to lambda versions. Example, dev can point to latest version 5, system test points to 4 and production points to 3. Aliases are just pointers so if one wants to put the latest version in production then one only needs to change the production alias to latest version, eg. 5.\n\nDepending on what a lambda function is doing, it could be a cheaper alternative to an EC2 server.\n\nLambda functions must be written in a stateless way with minimal overhead as they will be executed in a stateless manner. Default soft limit for executing lambda functions in parallel is 100. Depending on use, this could be extended by a simple request. Its advised to use versioning and aliases to deploy lambda functions.\n\nDry run is a feature with Amazon Lambda that allows one to check permissions without actually executing the lambda function.\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_147\">[](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-two%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Two%29 \"Evernote\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-two%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Two%29 \"Facebook\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-two%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Two%29 \"Twitter\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-two%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Two%29 \"Google+\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-two%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Two%29 \"LinkedIn\") [](https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share)<\/div><\/div>\n","html":"<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Achieving loose coupling with Events<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Amazon SQS, SNS, DynamoDB Streams, Kinesis Streams, Lambda.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the event driven architecture, two systems don&#8217;t need to know about each other.

In the invoicing system, if the user clicks reject button in the invoice email, the decider can then cancel the order but continue with dispatch if the user clicks approve button.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When the workflow starts the first time, SWF calls the decider which decides which step to go next. The control is then handed back to SWF from the decider and then based on the outcome of decider, SWF then goes to that step. The tasks that are executed can be executed asynchronously.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No visual way to create the work flows out of the box. Requires programmatic creation via SDK.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At least once delivery. Does not have all features of a fully fledged queuing solution. Highly scalable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Provides dead letter queues for messages that haven\u2019t been delivered.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Distributed nature means that some messages may not be available across all SQS servers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Message can appear in the queue after some time specified in delay seconds. Queue can restrict size of messages being put by specifying MaximumMessageSize. MessageRetentionPeriod specifies how long should a message be kept in the queue. This can be up to 14 days.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While receiving messages, one can use short polling or long polling. Short polling means that SQS returns messages in short bursts (couple at a time), however, with Long polling, it blocks you until it finds significant number of messages. The block time is specified by the client, could be 5-10 seconds. Use this if processing large number of messages in batch is easier than in small batches.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Visibility timeout is the time in which the message is invisible for a certain time and then becomes visible. This is for systems that need more time before they can pick up a message. The message handle can be used to extend this timeout if more time is needed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Java, client side buffering is allowed where the messages can be pre fetched into a local buffer. Automatically batches messages for send or delete operations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Queues can be shared to another AWS accounts with or without credentials (anonymously). Admin can also create policies that grant access to a specific queue. This can then be assigned to a role.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Requests incoming to a queue cannot be directly throttled. So if a queue is shared with someone else, they could potentially DDoS the queue and have you charged for each request which could be disastrous. However, this can be implicitly controlled by giving someone access to an Amazon API Gateway endpoint which then throttles all requests from there on to the SQS.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Simple Notification Service (SNS)<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pub-sub model. Messages are sent to the SNS which then propagates them down to different services or applications. SNS messages are not persisted while SQS messages are. Also, interaction with SNS is passive (push) while the one with SQS is active (poll). Also, usually in SNS, one publisher talks to multiple consumers while SQS is usually meant for one publisher talking to one subscriber.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Massively useful in decoupling applications. Supports event driven architecture where based on the message, the receivers could each do different things. For instance when an invoice is placed in SNS, one system that is subscribed could process the order associated with the invoice while second system could send email confirming the receipt of the order.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SNS provides good fan out for massively parallel tasks. Example, lambda can listen for SNS messages, do the processing and then push to S3.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Does not batch messages. Every notification is a message. Does not guarantee ordering of messages. SNS Delivery policy, that applies to HTTP subscribers can be used to control retries in case of message delivery failure. Messages can contain up to 256KB of data.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Message sizes or format can be controlled using the message structure attribute of the message. For instance, in case of SMS message, the characters can be restricted to 160 characters. Refer to the documentation on the AWS website.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use cloud watch to keep track of stats about SNS.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lambda<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Compute service similar to EC2. Automatically manages compute resources. Requires zero administration. Supports Python, Java (v8) and Node.js. Lets people focus on code, not administration. Removes need to have a lot of servers for a simple task. Hooks very well into Amazon AWS services. Known as connective tissue for AWS services. Eg. Fetch a file when it&#8217;s uploaded to S3, do something with it and then send a SNS push notification with the resulting output of data.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once created, lambda function can be invoked by:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Push model by publishing an event.<\/li>\n<li>Pull model by watching a stream or source (Kinesis stream or SQS queue polls)<\/li>\n<li>Synchronous invocation by calling a function or API directly from Lambda.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Push event model<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Event source must itself invoke a lambda function directly. From Amazon Echo, S3, SNS or Cognito. Example: User pushes an item to S3. S3 then pushes an event to Lambda which then assumes an execution role to process the file and upload the processed file back to lambda.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pull model<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lambda polls the event service and then on event does things. For example polling a DynamoDB or Kinesis stream. The polling does not affect the cost associated with making requests. Upon event detection, it assumes Execution role and processes the event.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Synchronous model<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Invoke function in lambda using RequestResposne invocation type. Function executes and then returns immediately.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When granting permissions, the source of the event must have permission to execute lambda functions. Whatever lambda then does must be able to execute operations that it is trying to do. For example, s3 upload event must have access to execute lambda. Then if the lambda function is uploading records to DynamoDB, it should have access to insert a DynamoDB record.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the role isn&#8217;t specified, it assumes basic lambda role. The basic role has the least privilege of being able to write a log file.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When writing a function, choose the amount of memory that you want to allocate. It then allocates CPU power. Additional memory can be configured in 64 MB increments upto 1536 MB. All calls are limited to five minutes of execution time. The default timeout is 3 seconds but can be set to any value between 1 and 300ms. Duration is calculated to nearest 100 milliseconds.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lambda functions be scheduled for execution. For example, get MI data every hour. Schedule can be set for fixed rate at every hour or 15 minutes. A crown expression can be provided.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Packages for lambda functions can go up to 50 MB in size.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Format for specifying handler for a Java application is &lt;package name&gt;.&lt;class name&gt;::&lt;function name&gt;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Functions take longer to execute the first time because it creates a new container and allocates resources to it. However its faster from there on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Very easy integration with AWS API gateway where based on a request, a lambda function can be executed. The incoming request parameters can be mapped to lambda function parameters using a mapping template. For incoming JSON data, the mapping template allows mapping using json path.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sounds like TDD is the best practice for writing lambda functions. All the functions should be strictly tested before publishing them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When subsequent updates are pushed to a lambda function, it automatically versions them. It allows reverting back to an old version if the latest is broken. One can also specify a specific version to lambda to execute. One can also define aliases to lambda versions. Example, dev can point to latest version 5, system test points to 4 and production points to 3. Aliases are just pointers so if one wants to put the latest version in production then one only needs to change the production alias to latest version, eg. 5.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Depending on what a lambda function is doing, it could be a cheaper alternative to an EC2 server.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lambda functions must be written in a stateless way with minimal overhead as they will be executed in a stateless manner. Default soft limit for executing lambda functions in parallel is 100. Depending on use, this could be extended by a simple request. Its advised to use versioning and aliases to deploy lambda functions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dry run is a feature with Amazon Lambda that allows one to check permissions without actually executing the lambda function.<\/p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_148\"><a class=\"a2a_button_evernote\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-two%2F&amp;linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Two%29\" title=\"Evernote\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-two%2F&amp;linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Two%29\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-two%2F&amp;linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Two%29\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-two%2F&amp;linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Two%29\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-two%2F&amp;linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Two%29\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share\"><\/a><\/div><\/div>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Wed, 02 Mar 2016 22:21:03 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 02 Mar 2016 22:21:47 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 02 Mar 2016 22:21:03 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":346,"title":"Notes from AWS Developer Training (Day Three)","slug":"notes-from-aws-developer-training-day-three","markdown":"\n### Creating Serverless Projects\n\nIn a server less environment, Amazon Lambda can be used in conjunction with Amazon API Gateway for HTTP interfacing, Amazon S3 for storage, Amazon ElastiCache for caching and DynamoDB\/RDS for database storage. Checkout the Servless Application Framework at [serverless.com](http:\/\/serverless.com) for more info.\n\n\n## Securing data in AWS\n\nInfrastructure should be treated as code, I.e. Version control systems. Automate security and increase testing frequency via CI\/CD. Fail early and fast. Test at production scale. No need to keep the test servers alive. Spin up the entire production environment in test, deploy the code, run the tests and then tear down the environment.\n\nDevOps provides efficiency that speeds up the development lifecycle (build > test > release > monitor > plan). Validate security in each step to avoid slowing down the whole lifecycle.\n\nAmazon\u2019s shared responsibility model.\n\nHow do we get certificates for the internal private DNS for an AWS EC2 instance?\n\nAll requests to AWS must be signed using access key ID and secret access key. If using the SDK, this is done automatically. However, if this is done manually, use signature version 4 to sign requests.\n\nSupport v2 and v4, most services support v4. V4 is more secure as it derives a key from secret access key and then uses that derived key to sign requests. V2 on the other hand does this very plainly as it uses the secret key directly to sign requests.\n\nOne way to provide permissions is to add users to a group that has policies attached to it. All users in that group have permissions assigned to them as long as they are in that group. Drawback is that this is a static set of permissions. As in if two developers are out on holiday for \u00a0weeks and only one is available, all three developers still have all the access. Also if one of the developers need access to EMR, and if policy is changed to include that permission, all the developers, whether or not they need it, inherit that permission.\n\nBetter way to do this is to use IAM roles. Create a role called EMR with the policy. The user that needs permission assumes that role. This provides that user with a new set of access key and secret key that has access to EMR.\n\nWhen authenticating with SSO or AD, the authenticating application checks if the user is in the right group to access the target application. If the user isn\u2019t in the right group then it must check if there are roles that can be assumed to access the target application. If the roles exist, the authenticating application then checks if the user is able or allowed to assume any of those roles. If the user is allowed, the application assumes the role for him, granting access. One of the ways this can be done is by using SAML assertion with IAM.\n\n\n## Getting started with IAM\n\nOnce you have the root account, create a general IAM account for yourself. Assign permissions that you need to yourself. If a admin is needed, create a group called Admins and then assign basic admin permissions to that role. When a new admin joins, he\/she can be added to Admins group. Give permissions to admins group as needed.\n\nFor a developer who joins the team, again create a Developers group and assign permissions to that group as needed. When a special permission is needed to access a specific thing, create a role for that and allow people to assume roles for a limited time or as long as they need it for. For temporary contractors and consultants, assign one permission called Assume Role. This allows them to temporarily assume roles when needed.\n\nThe assume role permission can be restricted by IP, as in you\u2019re only allowed to assume a role when you\u2019re on site.\n\nFor authentication, AWS management console needs username and password. Other tools like AWS CLI, SDKs and API queries need access key and secret keys.\n\nNEVER USE ROOT ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS ANYWHERE.\n\nTwo types of IAM permission types. User centric where each user is given access to specific resources. Second type of permission type is resource centric where specific access to a resource is opened up to a set of users.\n\nUse AWS provided library of pre-defined Policy Templates or AWS policy generator. Preferably, create policies in object oriented way using AWS Cloud Formation or AWS SDKs.\n\nIAM policy rule procedure is to deny access by default until access is explicitly allowed in all policies. If something is explicitly denied, it can never be allowed. Explicit deny cannot be overwritten.\n\nMight be possible to restrict users from uploading content above a certain size.\n\nFor external users, use OpenID Connect for authentication with external services like Google\/Facebook\/Twitter login along with IAM for authorisation.\n\n\n## Caching\n\nCloudFront caches content based on edge location. If content is available, it will serve from its edge location, if not, it will serve from S3.\n\nEach caching behaviour can be configured. Params like Path Pattern to be cached, request origin to forward to, if forward URLs should have query strings in them etc.\n\nPath patterns max is 255 chars. Case sensitive. Eg. \/*.jpg means cache all JPG files.\n\nWith regards to query strings, cache behaviour will differ based on value of query strings in the request. Example: \/hello?query1=a and \/hello?query2=b will result in different cache copies served. Cache can also serve different URLs based on different request header values or cookies.\n\nThe time to live (TTL) value controls how long the value should stay in the cache. Longer TTLs for static content, short for dynamic.\n\nA custom error page page can be configured to be serve if the cache fails to find the origin content (if origin changed but cache didn\u2019t for some reason and its expecting the file to be present on origin).\n\nAuthentication works via public\/private key pair. CloudFront has the public key while the application has the private key. The URLs must be signed before sending to cloud front. The application signs using its private key, sends URL to cloud front. If the URL is valid, cloud front serves the content.\n\nUser sessions can be stored in DynamoDB or ElastiCache, depending on need.\n\nElastiCache runs, underneath the covers, me cache or redis cluster. Provides managed service that include patching and backup.\n\nMemcache is known for high performance and scale. Allows running of large nodes with multiple cores or threads. Ability to scale in or out. Data can be partitioned across multiple shards. One downside is that the data model is very simple.\n\nRedis is quite similar to Memcache where it\u2019s open source and in memory. Redis can only scale vertically (check!!). Has simple master\/slave model, not shards (check!!). Comes with complex data types. Has pub\/sub capability \u2013 the client being informed of events on the server. Not very good for multi-threaded performance (check!!).\n\nCache is loaded by lazy loading as in data is only loaded when required.\n\n\n## CloudWatch\n\nOne can use CloudWatch agent to aggregate logs from EC2 instances to the central CloudWatch server. To do this, install the cloudwatch agent on the EC2 instance.\n\nFrom any log streams, custom cloudwatch metric can be created. Once the metric is created, an alarm can be configured.\n\nCloud watch alarms can call HTTP endpoints, like calling web hooks to trigger different kind of behaviours based on the event.\n\nCloud watch metrics can be aggregated on the server side by providing params like start and end times, period and metric names.\n\nCloudWatch dashboards can be used to provide a bird\u2019s eye view of all metrics pertaining to a specific application. It also allows adding of text widgets which one can use to provide some free text or images.\n\nJSON path expression can be used to search logs within CloudWatch. This style of expression can also be used to extract values from logs. Once values are extracted, they can be used to create a metric. For instance, use Regex to extract response times from tomcat logs, create a CloudWatch metric out of it called Latency and then set a CloudWatch alarm that fires off an email when latency exceeds 2 seconds.\n\nCloudWatch can be integrated into other services like Elasticsearch and Kibana. It can also work with AppDynamics or New Relic.\n\n\n## EC2 and Auto scaling\n\nEC2 instances can be launched with a script that is executed upon launch. This script or piece of code is called user data.\n\nWhen architecting a VPC, make sure that the auto scaling group is spread across two availability zones and each logical component (database server or application server) is in its own private subnet.\n\nAuto scaling can scale applications based on cloud watch metrics or time. Time based works like\u2026 Scaling out on Monday morning and scaling in on Friday evenings.\n\nAuto scaling forms two parts: Launch configuration and Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Launch configuration tells it how to launch something and what to do when it\u2019s launched. AMI tells it what to launch. AMI is in three categories: Bare (nothing but base image), Silver (optimised based OS image with prerequisites (Java\/Node) installed, Gold (Fully fledged application with application code and prerequisites.\n\nIf one wants the deployment to fail if something in user data fails, then one needs to initiate the cfn-signal with -e option specifying the error code. One can also use cfn-in it to initialise the script. This attribute in cloud formation will do roll back on its own without the sub-script having to call cfn-signal.\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_149\">[](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-three%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Three%29 \"Evernote\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-three%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Three%29 \"Facebook\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-three%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Three%29 \"Twitter\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-three%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Three%29 \"Google+\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F02%2Fnotes-from-aws-developer-training-day-three%2F&linkname=Notes%20from%20AWS%20Developer%20Training%20%28Day%20Three%29 \"LinkedIn\") [](https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share)<\/div><\/div>\n","html":"<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Creating Serverless Projects<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a server less environment, Amazon Lambda can be used in conjunction with Amazon API Gateway for HTTP interfacing, Amazon S3 for storage, Amazon ElastiCache for caching and DynamoDB\/RDS for database storage.

CloudFront has the public key while the application has the private key. The URLs must be signed before sending to cloud front. The application signs using its private key, sends URL to cloud front. If the URL is valid, cloud front serves the content.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">User sessions can be stored in DynamoDB or ElastiCache, depending on need.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ElastiCache runs, underneath the covers, me cache or redis cluster. Provides managed service that include patching and backup.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Memcache is known for high performance and scale. Allows running of large nodes with multiple cores or threads. Ability to scale in or out. Data can be partitioned across multiple shards. One downside is that the data model is very simple.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Redis is quite similar to Memcache where it&#8217;s open source and in memory. Redis can only scale vertically (check!!). Has simple master\/slave model, not shards (check!!). Comes with complex data types. Has pub\/sub capability &#8211; the client being informed of events on the server. Not very good for multi-threaded performance (check!!).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cache is loaded by lazy loading as in data is only loaded when required.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">CloudWatch<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One can use CloudWatch agent to aggregate logs from EC2 instances to the central CloudWatch server. To do this, install the cloudwatch agent on the EC2 instance.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From any log streams, custom cloudwatch metric can be created. Once the metric is created, an alarm can be configured.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cloud watch alarms can call HTTP endpoints, like calling web hooks to trigger different kind of behaviours based on the event.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cloud watch metrics can be aggregated on the server side by providing params like start and end times, period and metric names.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">CloudWatch dashboards can be used to provide a bird&#8217;s eye view of all metrics pertaining to a specific application. It also allows adding of text widgets which one can use to provide some free text or images.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">JSON path expression can be used to search logs within CloudWatch. This style of expression can also be used to extract values from logs. Once values are extracted, they can be used to create a metric. For instance, use Regex to extract response times from tomcat logs, create a CloudWatch metric out of it called Latency and then set a CloudWatch alarm that fires off an email when latency exceeds 2 seconds.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">CloudWatch can be integrated into other services like Elasticsearch and Kibana. It can also work with AppDynamics or New Relic.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">EC2 and Auto scaling<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">EC2 instances can be launched with a script that is executed upon launch. This script or piece of code is called user data.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When architecting a VPC, make sure that the auto scaling group is spread across two availability zones and each logical component (database server or application server) is in its own private subnet.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Auto scaling can scale applications based on cloud watch metrics or time. Time based works like\u2026 Scaling out on Monday morning and scaling in on Friday evenings.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Auto scaling forms two parts: Launch configuration and Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Launch configuration tells it how to launch something and what to do when it&#8217;s launched. AMI tells it what to launch. AMI is in three categories: Bare (nothing but base image), Silver (optimised based OS image with prerequisites (Java\/Node) installed, Gold (Fully fledged application with application code and prerequisites.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If one wants the deployment to fail if something in user data fails, then one needs to initiate the cfn-signal with -e option specifying the error code. One can also use cfn-in it to initialise the script. This attribute in cloud formation will do roll back on its own without the sub-script having to call cfn-signal.<\/p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div

If an environment has multiple JVMs running then each maps to a node.\n\nTier is a logical piece of application. For example a piece of functionality. Each web server has node. A single tier can span multiple web servers and each of those web servers can contain multiple nodes.\n\nApplication traffic is organised into business transactions. Each transaction is a distinct user activity like Login or register etc. When a request comes in for the first time, it is tagged with a GUID and that GUID is tracked across the environment. Requests with similar patterns are grouped together. This group is then given a default name. This is default name is based on how the application is designed.\n\nSince each business transaction works across nodes, each has its own flow map.\n\nA business transaction is a specific user activity. It represents a flow of data across the application. A tier, on the other hand represents a static, logical set of services.\n\nTransaction snapshot is a static state of a transaction at any given time. It collects detailed information regarding one business transaction at any given time.\n\nPeriodic snapshot is a snapshot that\u2019s taken once every 10 minutes. This is taken regardless of any errors occurring within the application.\n\nSlow and error transaction snapshot is a snapshot that is taken when calls happening below a certain threshold or when errors are happening above a certain error rate.\n\nSnapshots can be archived. Once a snapshot is archived, it is permanently visible in the UI and won\u2019t get deleted with periodic cleanup. A transaction that has been archived cannot be unarchived and must be deleted if archive is no longer needed.\n\n### AppDynamics architecture\n\nApp server agent. This could be .NET, Java, PHP etc. This is mandatory.\n\nMachine agent is optional. Collects raw metrics regarding the machine that it is on.\n\nAppDynamics supports role based authentication. Also supports other integrations like LDAP\/SAML etc.\n\nAppDynamics controller never actively initiates connection to an agent. The agent connects to the AppDynamics controller which then responds with any additional requests.\n\nBaseline is a set of values calculated from metrics within a time range. We could capture \u201cideal\u201d scenario by recording a baseline when application was running smoothly.

If an environment has multiple JVMs running then each maps to a node.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tier is a logical piece of application. For example a piece of functionality. Each web server has node. A single tier can span multiple web servers and each of those web servers can contain multiple nodes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Application traffic is organised into business transactions. Each transaction is a distinct user activity like Login or register etc. When a request comes in for the first time, it is tagged with a GUID and that GUID is tracked across the environment. Requests with similar patterns are grouped together. This group is then given a default name. This is default name is based on how the application is designed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since each business transaction works across nodes, each has its own flow map.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A business transaction is a specific user activity. It represents a flow of data across the application. A tier, on the other hand represents a static, logical set of services.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Transaction snapshot is a static state of a transaction at any given time. It collects detailed information regarding one business transaction at any given time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Periodic snapshot is a snapshot that\u2019s taken once every 10 minutes. This is taken regardless of any errors occurring within the application.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Slow and error transaction snapshot is a snapshot that is taken when calls happening below a certain threshold or when errors are happening above a certain error rate.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Snapshots can be archived. Once a snapshot is archived, it is permanently visible in the UI and won\u2019t get deleted with periodic cleanup. A transaction that has been archived cannot be unarchived and must be deleted if archive is no longer needed.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">AppDynamics architecture<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">App server agent. This could be .NET, Java, PHP etc. This is mandatory.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Machine agent is optional. Collects raw metrics regarding the machine that it is on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">AppDynamics supports role based authentication. Also supports other integrations like LDAP\/SAML etc.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">AppDynamics controller never actively initiates connection to an agent. The agent connects to the AppDynamics controller which then responds with any additional requests.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Baseline is a set of values calculated from metrics within a time range. We could capture \u201cideal\u201d scenario by recording a baseline when application was running smoothly. Then at a later date, when application isn\u2019t performing optimally, one can compare the current performance with the historic \u201cideal\u201d baseline to identify problems.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Baseline can also be a dynamic, rolling baseline where, for example, every monday 2pm, baseline is taken. Now next monday at 2pm metrics are compared to the baseline that was taken on the previous monday. This is a dynamic baseline so if the current performance peaks, the baseline will adjust itself to compensate for the peak.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When a baseline is defined, if the deviation of the current data is certain level above the baseline, AppDynamics will automatically raise an alarm indicating that.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rather than deleting a transaction, it is better to exclude it as restoring a deleted transaction is much harder (needs re-creating) than restoring a excluded one.<\/p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_156\"><a class=\"a2a_button_evernote\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F23%2Fappdynamics-power-user-training-notes-day-one%2F&amp;linkname=AppDynamics%20Power%20User%20Training%20Notes%20%E2%80%93%20Day%20One\" title=\"Evernote\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F23%2Fappdynamics-power-user-training-notes-day-one%2F&amp;linkname=AppDynamics%20Power%20User%20Training%20Notes%20%E2%80%93%20Day%20One\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F23%2Fappdynamics-power-user-training-notes-day-one%2F&amp;linkname=AppDynamics%20Power%20User%20Training%20Notes%20%E2%80%93%20Day%20One\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F23%2Fappdynamics-power-user-training-notes-day-one%2F&amp;linkname=AppDynamics%20Power%20User%20Training%20Notes%20%E2%80%93%20Day%20One\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F03%2F23%2Fappdynamics-power-user-training-notes-day-one%2F&amp;linkname=AppDynamics%20Power%20User%20Training%20Notes%20%E2%80%93%20Day%20One\" title=\"LinkedIn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share\"><\/a><\/div><\/div>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 23:34:44 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 23:38:28 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 23:34:44 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":361,"title":"AppDynamics Power User Training Notes - Day Two","slug":"appdynamics-power-user-training-notes-day-two","markdown":"\nHealth rules are conditions that if fulfilled relate to good health for a particular node.

In a nutshell, a user uploads an image and then the website does a whole load of processing on that image and returns with the results. Depending on the size of the image it could take a while for it to load the results. The websites does other stuff as well so the scenario where a few users are concurrently uploading images, waiting for response while a whole load of other set of users are navigating to other parts of the website is very real. The performance was respectable, however, I wanted more.\n\nAfter a couple of hours of investigating around the issue, I finally settled on using forks for handling this type of load. A fork is a process that is spun off of a parent process. In this case, when a user uploads an image on the website, the node server creates a fork that then does the image processing. Meanwhile, the parent process hooks into the \u201cexit\u201d callback of the forked process so that it knows when the forked process has exited. When this happens, the parent process returns the results to the user.\n\nNow, every node process, no matter how asynchronous, is single threaded. This means that it utilises at most a single core of your CPU. So the fact that the new fork powered architecture creates a fork process to handle the heavy image processing means lower load on the single node process. It also means that the load is spread evenly across cpu cores.\n\nHowever, here lies the problem. Every time a new customer arrives on the website and uploads a new image, the node server spins up a new process. So, if many customers arrive and upload large images which could take 10-15 seconds to load, it will spin up a new process for each of those customers. Since each process maps to roughly one CPU core, having too many processes doing CPU intensive things will start to slow down everything thats running on that machine. This means that they will slow down each other as they race to get as much CPU time as they can.\n\nThis problem also has a simple solution. Limit the number of forks so that they do not exceed a certain number. This number will vary upon usage and circumstances but after doing some benchmarking, in my case, this was 3. This meant that my application should, at any given time run at most 3 forks (processes).\n\nIn technical speak, this is called pooling of resources. The idea behind this is that you create a pool of fixed size and then take things in and out of pool. Translating this into what I needed to do with my fork problem, I needed a pool of size 3 to manage my forks so that it will allow me to put at most 3 things in it. If I tried to put more things in it, it should queue those things, wait for current things that are running in it to finish and then automatically start the queued things.\n\nI googled for some time, trying to find a good way to pool my forks. I found a couple of solutions but none were as elegant as I\u2019d like them to be. I did find some good ones but they either were deprecated or weren\u2019t being maintained anymore. So, I got my IDE ready and started programming what will be known as the [forkpool](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/forkpool) module.\n\n\n# Forkpool\n\nThe module comprises of two basic things. <span class=\"lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline\">Forkpool<\/span>\u00a0and <span class=\"lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline\">Forklet<\/span>\u00a0. <span class=\"lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline \">Forklet<\/span>\u00a0 is a definition of a fork instance. For example, if you wanted to fork a node module named <span class=\"lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline \">worker.js<\/span>\u00a0, your forklet will comprise of three things. First being the location of the module, second being additional environment configuration needed to run the fork and third (optional)\u00a0being the time within which the fork must complete its execution (if it doesn\u2019t, it gets killed). The third option of specifying timeout was the one I couldn\u2019t find available in any of the existing fork pools and hence decided to create it.\n\nSo once you have a <span class=\"lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline \">forklet<\/span>\u00a0, you can use the forkpool to create a fork. Upon creating the forkpool, you can define the size of the pool in its constructor. This value is the maximum number of forks you want running in parallel at any given time.\n\nOnce you have a <span class=\"lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline \">forkpool<\/span>\u00a0 and <span class=\"lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline \">forklet<\/span>\u00a0 objects you can execute forks. If you execute more forks than the capacity, it will queue the rest of the forks up and execute them one\u00a0by one as the running forks finish their execution.\n\nThe module also comes with a event system comprised of a set of events. Every time something happens with the forks, a event is triggered. You can subscribe to events on a specific fork or to all forks across the entire pool. Working within the asynchronous architecture of node, this just made sense. There are various kinds of events that let you know what is happening to a fork. These are <span class=\"lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline\">scheduled<\/span>\u00a0, <span class=\"lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline\">started<\/span>\u00a0, <span class=\"lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline\">timedout<\/span>\u00a0and <span class=\"lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline \">exited<\/span>\u00a0. Event callbacks also come with additional contextual information that provide more information regarding that specific event.\n\nCheckout these links below for more information regarding the module:\n\n[NPM](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/forkpool), [Github](https:\/\/github.com\/manthanhd\/forkpool), [Travis CI](https:\/\/travis-ci.org\/manthanhd\/forkpool)\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list a2a_target\" id=\"wpa2a_161\">[](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/evernote?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F04%2F08%2Fsimplifying-management-of-forks-with-npm-forkpool-module%2F&linkname=Simplifying%20management%20of%20forks%20with%20npm%20forkpool%20module \"Evernote\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F04%2F08%2Fsimplifying-management-of-forks-with-npm-forkpool-module%2F&linkname=Simplifying%20management%20of%20forks%20with%20npm%20forkpool%20module \"Facebook\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F04%2F08%2Fsimplifying-management-of-forks-with-npm-forkpool-module%2F&linkname=Simplifying%20management%20of%20forks%20with%20npm%20forkpool%20module \"Twitter\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F04%2F08%2Fsimplifying-management-of-forks-with-npm-forkpool-module%2F&linkname=Simplifying%20management%20of%20forks%20with%20npm%20forkpool%20module \"Google+\") [](http:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manthanhd.com%2F2016%2F04%2F08%2Fsimplifying-management-of-forks-with-npm-forkpool-module%2F&linkname=Simplifying%20management%20of%20forks%20with%20npm%20forkpool%20module \"LinkedIn\") [](https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share)<\/div><\/div>\n","html":"<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Backstory<\/h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Recently, I&#8217;ve been working on a project that does a lot of heavy weight image processing.
