  <h1>How to extract words from a string in C# (Split string)</h1>

  <p>This is incredibly easy in C#. First of all, you need to have a string from which you want to extract words. A word is a string separated by spaces. To do that, just say:</p>

<p><code>string s = "Welcome to my blog!";</code></p>

<p>Now, when I use the <code>Split</code> command, it will return an array of individual strings. So, the implementation will be:</p>

<p><code>string[] words = s.Split(" ",StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);</code></p>

<p>As a result, <code>words</code> array will contain “Welcome”, “to”, “my”, “blog!”.</p>
