  <p>ListView is extremely useful in displaying tabular data in C#. Yet, it is an easy to use control.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Drag the control onto your form and note its name. In this instance, I am going to use ListView1 as name.</li>
	<li>You will have to add columns to it now. This is how you do it.
<code>ListView1.Columns.Add("ColumnName");</code>
If you have 5 columns, then you will have to do it five times.</li>
	<li>Now, you will have to have each row that you want to insert as a single dimension string array. Number of items in this array should be equal to number of added columns. If it's not, then rest of string elements will not show up.</li>
	<li>Add the string array to a ListViewItem. For that, you will have to create a ListViewItem first. ListViewItem's constructor would allow you to pass the string array to it. Do it by typing:
