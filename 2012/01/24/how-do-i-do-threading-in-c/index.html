  <h1>Writing multi-threaded code in C#</h1>

  <p>Threading in C# is no big deal. It has the easiest implementation I’ve ever seen. First of all, you need to have a method that you want to execute on a different thread. For this instance, I’ll put method called Calculate(). Now, this method has to be a void. However, it can take any amount of parameters. So, it can be:</p>

<p><code>public void Calculate()
</code>
or</p>

<p><code>public void Calculate(int x, int y)
</code>
Now that we know what to execute, we need to create a thread with this method. This is done by:</p>

<p><code>Thread t = new Thread(Calculate());
</code>
I can now run the thread by typing:</p>

<p><code>t.Start();
</code>
