<div style="text-align: justify;">So as you all know, I am currently in my final year of BEng (Hons) Software Engineering. In my final year, one of the courses that I am studying is Programming Frameworks. This course introduces to the academic side of Software Engineering and covers topics like quality plans, quality control, advanced methodologies, planning, frameworks etc.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">My coursework for this course was to prepare a quality plan for writing an academic paper and then write the academic paper. The main topic of the academic paper was to compare and contrast one of the three concepts with an academic paper "No Silver Bullet - Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering" written by Fred Brooks. I prepared the quality plan, wrote the academic paper and submitted the coursework last month. I received a really good mark for it - 88% and thus I thought that I should share the academic paper that I wrote in LaTeX. You can download the academic paper from here.</div>
