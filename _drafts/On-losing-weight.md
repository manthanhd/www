<p class="has-drop-cap">Coming from an Indian family, I've always been very "healthy". My parents always encouraged healthy eating, i.e. no/minimal junk/fast food, but all of us in the family have always been on the heavy side. When critiqued, this was always countered with - "we're healthy because we're wealthy". I can see where they are coming from but it never really made sense to me. Maybe in the olden times if you were rich you could afford more calorie-dense foods and subsequently then had a waistline to show for it. Having said that, this idea doesn't stand in the modern world.</p>

<p>Looking back, the only time I was lean was during my early school life. Every day at school we had an hour of activity at the beginning of the day. For a few of these years I did skating, then karate, followed by field hockey. You can see why I was lean, an hour of relatively intense activity each day is a good way to keep things in shape. Additionally, we had a "20 minute short break" in the afternoon when we would play things like hide and seek, cricket etc, further activity that would keep me fit. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite that, I think its fair to say that even during and after school life, my weight kept steadily going up. My daily routine did not involve keeping track of this specifically but on occasions, like being at a train station in India or being at any medical facility to see a relative, I'd measure my weight and come off the scale with a slight disappointment. Although, as always, if a family member sees me doing this, they would cheer me up, saying "oh look how healthy you've become". Yeah right!</p>

<h2><strong>Previous attempts of losing weight</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As far back as I can remember, I've done quite a few things in past to lose weight. One such attempt was when my weight reached 86 kilos. I had just arrived in UK at the time. Since I had the same family mentality, I thought I had gained weight because I had come to a different more prosperous country. To lose weight, I thought I would just start walking everywhere. I mean not everywhere, I was still surrounded by people with the "back home" mentality who would say things like "you can't walk to the train station, its too far!". Dude, its only a mile but ok, lets catch that bus. On top of this, if I did walk a mile to that train station, I'd grab a portion of chips from a chip shop nearby as a "reward" to "refuel" myself. I wasn't measuring my weight regularly so didn't  know what was working and what wasn't. Needless to say it wasn't working.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next time I checked my weight was when I was at the doctors clinic for a regular check up. I weighed myself, I was around 93. It was at this time that I stopped walking because it "wasn't working". I focused myself at getting things done, I was studying at university at the time so I thought I would just use the fastest route possible to get to places so that I have more time left. My grades were stellar, albeit I am not sure taking a bus instead of walking helped much in this regard because I've always had good grades throughout my academic life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fast forwarding, the second attempt was when I had a job after graduation. I was living in Nottingham. Quite a few people in my workplace were active. So to lose weight, I started running. I downloaded this app called "Couch to 5k" and off I went. Except it was hard work. Very very hard work. I would get shin splints; feet would hurt long after the run. My glutes would hurt keeping me up at night. It was supposed to be only 3x a week but it felt like hell. Mentally it was worse. I felt like "a fat guy running on the road", disgusted at myself and felt worse if I caught someone even vaguely gazing in my direction. Additionally I made a mistake by telling my parents about the new running plan. "Its ridiculous" they said. "The weight won't go anywhere", "we're built like this", "you can't change your physical structure", "we're strong and healthy". In addition to the normal questions like "what did you have for lunch/dinner" there would now be questions like "did you run today?". If I said yes, they'd say "make sure you eat to make up for it". Yes, thanks, as if it wasn't already hard. Setting off was hard, pressing on was harder. I still pushed on for 6 weeks before giving up. I felt like I wasn't going anywhere with running and the constant pain and suffering were unbearable. Mentally it was getting more and more difficult to fight my demons when they were getting more power over me through my family. I felt exercising wasn't for me and if I kept gaining weight, I'll just accept the consequences.</p>

<h2><strong>What? The bike to work scheme?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Have you seen this bike to work scheme?" asked my colleague who had just joined the company. He was asking to see if I knew about it. I had heard a lot of people mention the scheme but never took interest in it. I started reading and 5 minutes in I said "I'm buying a bike". Usually, I am not the one to make spontaneous decisions but this was definitely one of those. I don't think my colleague bought himself a new bike but it definitely landed me to a local "Cycle Republic" store the very next day to browse and check out new bikes. One of my friends suggested to go for a "Cyclocross" as a first bike as it would be a good introduction to road cycling but would still allow me to ride off road in trails etc. That was it. I chose Boardman CX Team 2017 and picked it up from the store the next day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Riding a bike was hard work. Not that I had not done it before or that I didn't know how to ride it. But it was hard. I rode it home and I made it, barely. My first bike ride was the ride to work. It is just over a mile and it was difficult. Not as bad as running, i.e. no feet or shin splints, but hard on my cardiovascular system. I was sweating, out of breath in a 1.2 mile bike ride, with average speed of 8 miles per hour. But I did it and that was important. I didn't cycle to work every day, but I kept my bike at work because it was more secure there. On bike ride days, I would walk to work, change into cycling clothes and then take it out from there. It started off with only weekends. The 1.2 mile distance became 2 miles very quickly. Speed went up from 8 miles an hour to 10 miles an hour. I was seeing progression happen. Slowly but still seeing something happening was rewarding. I told my parents about my bike riding but the same slew of comments followed aimed at getting me to stop exercising. Health advice wasn't really advice at all. But unlike before, seeing the progression and no injury helped me keep at it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next milestone ride was around the "Big Track" in Nottingham. I think its about 10-ish miles. And I used to regularly ride around it. Average speed kept creeping up, albeit slowly. That very first 10 mile ride was a significant achievement that materialised in a much needed mental boost. The only way I was able to get around it was by telling myself "I just have to complete it, speed doesn't matter, I just have to get around it". Cycling became means for me to explore the city and the neighbourhood. It was after maxing out the Big Track route that I started looking for longer routes. The longest ride I did within Nottingham was roughly 18 miles. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Feeling stronger, I decided it was time to step it up. The first "endurance" bike ride for me was the ride from Nottingham to Belvoir Castle. I thought I'd do a long ride to explore the castle and the surrounding area. It was difficult to get there by bus and since I didn't have a car, a bike ride was the only way. It was a 39 mile round-trip route. I didn't realise what I had signed up for until reached half way. I had 1 bottle of water and nothing to eat. Looking back, I didn't know what "ride nutrition" was. Headache started. I didn't know why this was happening - I wouldn't learn until a few years after. I stopped at a nearby service station, grabbed a bottle of water and a oat bar. Finally made it to the castle and rode back home. The headache was throbbing. That day I would sleep with the headache but with an immense sense of achievement. The next day, I told my parents, they were happy but still the same barrage of comments followed for me to stop cycling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Work pressure started building up, I got promoted a few times, more responsibility came on. This meant reduced leisure time. Bike riding ground to a halt. Few months later, the same friend who originally suggested me to get a Cyclocross bike invited me to ride with him in Peak District. The invitation meant so much to me that I accepted without knowing what the distance or the elevation was. I just rode with him. It was about 60 miles ride in the end, with a warm curry for lunch at the top of one of the peaks. It was fabulous and I really needed that boost in confidence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Few months on with riding on/off, it really ground to a halt. I didn't ride for a year (or was it two?), mainly work issues but also few family related issues. I discovered my Dad who was in his 60s suffered a heart attack. Suddenly he wasn't so invincible anymore. He was always "healthy", so what happened? I wondered. </p>

<h2>A breath of fresh air</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I changed my job to working for Ripple in London. Moved from Nottingham to London living with my cousin. Unlike living on my own in Nottingham where I had to cook for myself, here my aunt cooked food for me every day. It was fun living with friends and relatives. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New job, new people, new mindset, I thought. I was ready to take on anything. As part of my induction I went to San Francisco. I was scheduled to be there for 1 week but got extended to stay an extra week. More time to explore the city! I was fearful of public transport for some reason so started walking everywhere. Walked about 2 miles along the pier and my feet started hurting. I stopped, took a taxi back to the hotel. Next day was Sunday. I started walking again and felt pain shooting through my shins. Shin splints without running? Whaa? I didn't go anywhere that day. There would be subsequent visits to San Francisco in which I would be repeatedly reminded of my poor fitness. I couldn't even tell my doctor about it. What would I say? "Hey I'm a 26 year old who is struggling to walk 2 miles?".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I started to settle in London, I found my old weight scale. I replaced the batteries, turned it on and weighed myself. It said 116. Is that pounds? No I set it to kilos. Let me check. Yes its Kilos. F*cking hell! No wonder walking in San Francisco was so painful. My legs had to carry all of this for 2 miles?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I fished out my laptop and started googling. Search terms like:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Ideal weight by height</li><li>BMI calculator</li><li>Body fat</li><li>What is TDEE?</li><li>How many calories in a kilo of fat?</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All these questions and much much more. Then I realised something. I had a bike and I used to work not too far from where I lived. What if I cycled to work and lost weight that way?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I looked it up. Cycling to work is just over 6 miles, with "Cycle Superhighway" for most of the way. This time though, my goal wasn't weight loss. I wanted to build stamina. I wanted to explore London like I had explored Nottingham. I wanted to just ride.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn't ride my bike until Ripple moved offices in London, from Canary Wharf to Angel Court in Bank. It made the distance to be little over the original distance but still well paved, with cycle paths most of the way. I decided on a day to ride my bike. I didn't actually ride it at all on that day but rather did an exploratory ride on the weekend of that same week. It went little worse than ok. I was out of breath quickly and felt tired. It would be a few days after my exploratory ride that I would ride to work for the first time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I only have to ride to work once a week" I said to myself. Two weeks later, "maybe I can ride two times a week". I started riding two times a week. "Maybe 3 now". And so on, until it became an every day thing. I was still getting out of breath but my average speed was improving slowly. From 12 miles an hour to 13. I didn't see it rise to 14 miles an hour until quite some time after that. I didn't even know it and I was riding 50-60 miles a week. 12-ish miles a day, 5 times a week = 60 miles! Whoa maths!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mantra of "I just have to ride to work" kept me going. Day after day, "I just have to get there". No weight loss, no fitness, I just have to cycle to work, that's it. Summer turned winter. Things started to get physically easier as I was building fitness steadily but mentally harder. The demons in my mind started whispering "its cold outside, just take the tube", "I'll get frostbite if I ride in 2 degrees", "tyres might slip in icy conditions". However, "I just have to get to work" suppressed all those voices in rain, sleet and snow. I invested in winter cycling gear to support my riding so that I have fewer excuses to escape from. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a few months, I moved out of my cousin's place around Stratford to living on my own in 1 bed flat in Royal Victoria Docks. As if by magic, the distance remained the same to work, albeit a little longer. I continued cycling to work. Now that I was living on my own and cooking my own food, I had an opportunity to control my diet so that I could build that stamina faster and more efficiently. I diversified my cooking palette.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Baby steps</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roughly around this time, or maybe few months earlier, I had started focusing on portion control. I could never say no to a good meal but I could control how much of it I consumed. This was hard in the beginning, as all things are, but things started to get normalized with time. I remember I used to eat a big bowl of rice with a big bowl of home made curry for dinner with "few" rotis. In my mind, since I cooked everything at home it was all healthy. I mean, how do you measure calorific value of home cooked food anyway? Its not as if when you start cooking, the calorie labels start popping up. Well, there was one way to do it. Measuring a rough estimate based on the ingredients in the recipe. So for instance if my cooked curry roughly had potatoes, garlic, ginger, tomatoes, chillis sautéed in sunflower oil, and various spices, I should be able to get a rough estimate by calculating calorific values of:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Sautéed potatoes</li><li>1tsp sunflower oil</li><li>garlic, ginger, chillis</li><li>round up for spice powders (they are low in calorie values themselves and are used sparingly)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Much to my shock, I was consuming about 1200-1500 calories for lunch, and roughly about the same for dinner. Plus whatever was in my snacks. Don't get me wrong, I was getting fitter - which is why I was going further and faster on the bike, but I wasn't losing much weight. I wasn't gaining much either because I was burning about 800-1000 calories a day cycling around + bonus calories burned on weekends (1200-1800 calories). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Knowing myself, I didn't go for calorie restriction straight away but I thought general portion control bit by bit would work better. Instead of a big bowl of rice, I'd start with half a bowl of rice and instead of a big bowl of curry, I'd reduce it by a bit. Slowly and surely, bit by bit I was etching away at my portions. If I was ordering a large pizza for dinner, instead of eating half a pizza, I'd eat a third and save it for two more servings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My cooking style also changed a little bit. Reducing the amount of oil and adding more greens. Going for boiled potatoes instead of fried. Fried eggs? What about poached eggs?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the bike I was still getting faster. I had found an app called Komoot which allowed me to design and follow cycling routes. I would design these long routes and then on weekends just follow them with the mindset of "I just have to complete the route". If I got tired or exhausted, I'd just stop for a water break. In no time my weekend rides were spanning 4-5 hours, covering 60+ miles in a single ride. Soon enough, my standard ride became the London Parks Tour, which was a route from Canary Wharf, Richmond Park, Battersea Park, Hyde Park, Regents Park, Camden Market (not a park I know but a stop for grabbing lunch), Victoria Park, Olympic Park and back to Canary Wharf. Doing this 100 km route almost every weekend added quite a punch to my weekly mileage and played an important role in improving my fitness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would be unfair for me to paint it all as a rosy picture. There were doubts. Doubts when on the bike, doubts when off the bike. Starting a 100km ride is no easy feat for someone who is new to all this. The first doubt crept in as soon as I would wake up on the Saturday morning. "maybe this is one of my rest weekends and I don't cycle 100kms today", "Rest is important and I shouldn't ignore it". "Just relax! I need to make more out of my Netflix subscription that I am paying for!", "I could just go to friends or my cousins place and spend the day there, chilling". This constant doubting myself would last all the way 100kms, till I got home. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the bike it would be like: "I don't have to do 100 km, I can just do a quick 5 km ride and call it a day", "there's no evidence of this 100 km ride working for me, its probably not working and its a waste of time", and my favourite "I could just get off the bike, and get a taxi back". I never ever gave into a single one of them. I knew as soon as I gave into one, the next time it would be harder for me to resist and it would just keep getting harder. Cycling was a lifestyle choice. Portion control was a lifestyle choice. Its not temporary. I am going to carry this on for the rest of my life. So why must I give in? Other people who overtook me on my bike rides were faster than me. Why can't I be like one of them? The only way to get faster on bike was to get fitter and lighter. There was only one way to achieve both of those things: Consistency.</p>

<h2>100 miles? Its nothing!</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next big milestone for me was the ride to Cambridge and back. I met Aleks at Ripple and very quickly found out that he is also a cyclist. I think the furthest he had ridden his bike was 30-ish miles, and the furthest I had ridden was 60-ish miles. I can't exactly remember how this idea came about but we started looking at routes from London to Cambridge and back. The route was about 100 miles in total (=160 km) with relatively mild elevation. I was enthusiastic about the idea of riding 100 miles with someone, although I 100% expected him to cancel the ride with some bulls**t excuse. The cancellation never came and the day of the bike ride arrived.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We left relatively early in the morning on our bikes. I still had the cyclocross bike, maybe not the best choice for this kind of ride but it was what I had. Reaching Cambridge was moderately hard. My focus throughout was pacing, I was aiming for 10 miles per hour average pace - that would get us there and back in 10 hours, a reasonable time but more importantly, it would prevent muscle fatigue from setting in early. We'd be using more of our aerobic capacity which can be replenished much more easily than anaerobic capacity. It was all great plan on paper, but some of the steep hills on the way severely interfered with that plan.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the way there, on some occasions I felt I slowed down Aleks, on others I felt he was slower than me. We somehow reached Cambridge. The euphoria of having ridden 60 miles was incredible. We were buzzing with excitement. We parked our bikes outside a pub, got some food and then wandered around the town a bit. Setting off back to London was difficult but we had to do it of course. Doubts were there throughout this journey. I was tracking where the train stations were on the way back with hope that if I get too tired, I/we would just catch a train back. Of course I never gave in and we kept cycling. I was pretty tired at this point, the descents were fun on the way to Cambridge, but when they turned into hills on the way back, it was not so fun. I think I walked couple of those hills. They were long and quite sucky in terms of energy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we got closer to London, I found that my rear tyre was a bit heavy. Something had punctured it. It was dark at this time and having Aleks to help out with the puncture was a blessing in disguise. I had no idea what I was doing. I knew the theory behind how to fix a puncture but didn't know how to get the tyre and the tube off the wheel. Aleks knew the latter so it was perfect. We struggled with it a bit but managed to fix it. That ride back through the dark canal path is something to remember. There were no street lights. I had my headlight which was just sufficient to illuminate the path. Aleks was following me. We were blazing through these trails not knowing what would come through in front of us. The rustling of leaves under our wheels and the bushes brushing past our arms in almost complete darkness was both terrifying and exciting. Needless to say, we stopped and found a way out of the canal route.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being back on the main road felt like a breath of fresh air. I was filled with a powerful sense of enthusiasm, I wanted to get home before midnight and I was definitely riding like it. I wanted to see the remainder of the distance on my phone go down to zero. Apart from stopping for grabbing a quick dinner from a Co-Op that was almost closed, we zoomed past everything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I got home, my legs felt they had 100 miles in them. I checked my Garmin and it crudely reminded me that it was actually 120 miles, lest I forget. Sleep came to me with ease like never before and the lights were out before I knew it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next day I checked my Garmin watch to analyse my ride. I had burned a whooping 5,472 calories and gained 1,222 m of elevation during my 122.85 mile ride over 10 hours and 23 minutes. All of these were record numbers for me. My brain was being very generous in rewarding me for this feat. I felt great the next day. Before doing the 100 mile ride, which is also called an Imperial Century, I read quite a bit about it on reddit cycling forums. People mentioned this euphoria, the unexplained sense of overwhelming joy and achivement that comes after riding 100 miles. I can verify that this is all true. Its better than anything you can ever imagine it would be like. The pain and suffering all gets pushed aside and your brain rewards you like never before with the cocktail of chemicals that represent this feeling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although, physically I was a little more than a broken man. Stairs were definitely out of the question. The few things I remember doing the next day were taking a warm bath to soothe the legs, watching TV and ordering food delivery.</p>

<h2>The sweet sweet Snowball Effect</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the 100 mile ride, things continued to be normal. I continued to cycle to work every day. Continued doing the weekend rides. I could've done another 100 mile ride but didn't manage to do one, mostly because of schedules. A 100 mile ride takes up a whole day with residual impact on the following day. With time, my weekend rides slowly started getting shorter, but with more frequency. I'd do two 20-30 mile rides on Saturday and Sunday than doing a single 40-60 mile ride on one of those days. I figured it'll help me keep a better balance for the calories burned - 800 to 1000 calories burned on each day is better than one day with 1500-1800 calories burned and then nothing on the next day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winter came. I moved my home again. Magically the distance to work remained about the same. I continued with my cycling, never missing a beat. This was partly fuelled by not wanting to use the London Underground. I had developed good fitness at this point and exercising while getting to work seemed more efficient than being cooped up in the Underground for 20-30 minutes, breathing air thats passed through god knew how many people. Fear of getting sick was another factor. I didn't want a week or two week break in my rountine. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can't pin point exactly when but one day I noticed that my belt was too long to go around my waist. I was surprised but logically it made sense. Until that point, I had been tightening more and more of my belt as my waistline was slowly shrinking. I used a pair of scissors to cut a small chunk off it so that it fit and went on with my day, never thinking of it again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've never paid much attention to my clothes, until one day I found that my trousers had too many folds on the waist. Again, I was surprised but it made sense. They were the wrong size after all. Not when I had bought them, but since I had started shrinking, they became the wrong size. It was this moment when I decided to pull out my old tape measure to measure myself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wish I could say that the tape measure was a bit dusty when I pulled it out. Except it wasn't. I keep my home in a pristine, clean condition so this would never happen. But it did have a sort of an old feel to it. I had hated this tape measure since the day I bought it. It brought me nothing but sadness from knowing all the clothes that I could never buy because they didn't sold them in my size.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I measured my waist. 38 inches. Wow! I've not seen that number in a long time. All my trousers were between 42-46 inches, with various fit styles. I had to go shopping. Probably for the first time in my life I was excited to go shopping for clothes. Walking into the store, I felt for the first time that I could fit in over 95% of the available selection, if not all of it. I think I was too excited on that day to buy anything. Nobody around me in the store could grasp this. The people in the store were just people, going on with their lives, browsing, making decisions on what to try and what to buy. Couples, friends, suggesting one another what they would look good in. Meanwhile, I was buzzing with joy and excitement of being able to select anything from the store and not getting disappointed because they didn't do it in that size. Although, I'd say 38 inches is right on the edge. Most stores, except uniqlo did up to 38 inches. Worst case scenario was that the item would be out of stock but they'd certainly do it in the size. Asking for 46 though and they'd most likely show either a smaller selection or plainly refuse that they didn't do anything in that size. On that day I bought nothing. I had a long way to go still. </p>

<p>It was around this time, my friend with whom I did cardio and strength sessions in a park over weekends, suggested I should update my wardrobe. He was right. My tshirts were bigger than me. My trousers were barely holding on, I could never wear them without a belt. He suggested to take one of our mutual friends out for shopping with me. </p>

<p>As with all planning, it took a few weeks (or maybe a month or two?) but the day finally came. In the morning, I measured myself - the tape said 34.4 inches. WHAT?! I must not be measuring it right. I never thought I had to google this but I looked up - "where is the waist human anatomy". Yep, I was definitely measuring it right. Self confidence shot through the roof. I probably cycled faster that day to work. Later in the day we went to one of the biggest clothing stores in central london to buy new clothes. We picked out a few items. Few trousers at 36 inches so that I could wear them rightaway and a couple at 34 inches which barely fit at the time. I also discovered that my tshirt size had dropped from XL to below L but above M. We bought a few tshirts and shirts too. Same formule - few in the right size at the time (L) and a couple in one size below (M).</p>

<p>The next day into the office wearing my new clothes was probably my best day into work. Not that I don't enjoy working, its literally my dream job so I am 8/10 on most days but this was even better. Definitely a 9/10. Hard work finally paying off with visible results to show for it. People started noticing the change. Before with the oversized clothes it was perhaps hard to see but now it was clear. Me seeing results on paper, like getting faster on the bike was one thing, others noticing and saying on their own volition was completely different. While it was awesome to have friends and family compliment me on the success, on the back of my mind, I knew the game wasn't over. I didn't want the satisfaction of people complimenting me cloud over my goals. I don't think anyone wanted to do that to me but sometimes we lose steam when we think we could settle down when we are feeling good about ourselves rathen than powering ahead and finishing the journey.</p>

<p>The worst case scenario in my head was that I would feel all giddy about people noticing and complimenting me that I would stop exercising, continue eating the same amount and gain the weight back. And this was not just in my head, there are sports science and medical papers that outline this behaviour. People who have lost weight are most likely to gain it back immediately after. I could see two worlds ahead of me. In one I gain the weight back and go back to square one, with my family telling me I told you so etc etc, in another I continue powering ahead and turn into some sort of athlete. It was on me to decide which one I wanted to be in.</p>

<p>I think that things that we notice depend entirely on a few things that are on our mind and horizon. Suddenly out of nowhere I was noticing where my friends, family, colleagues went to exercise. From all that I heard quite a bit around Virgin Active being a good choice - from the equipment, staff to just a general good all rounder facility.</p>

<p>I was looking to step things up. Browsing around cycling forums on the Interweb I found this whole culture of Indoor Cycling. People were using stationary bikes but most Pros were using trainers. After a few sleepless nights, watching indoor training videos, everything from what FTP is, to how to fix your bike to a direct drive trainer, I was hooked. I had just found a way to step things up.</p>

<p>I walked into Virgin Active during my lunch time. I had just devoured a wrap from Pret standing outside so had plenty of time on my hands to get a gym membership. The Fitness Instructor at the Virgin Active showed me around and looked like he was trying really hard to sell it to me. As soon as we arrived on the gym floor, I saw them. The glorious Wattbikes - the holy grail of Indoor training. I had made up my mind to join the gym anyway but now I was even more certain. I got a decent deal and so I signed the paperwork. I was in!</p>

<p>My first indoor training session was insane. I thought I was fit on a bike and still the Wattbike made me feel like that 116 kilo unfit trying to grind out the watts. My first FTP test result - 194 watts. Its not terrible but certainly not great from my perspective. I don't know how I got it in my head but I thought my FTP was going to be at least 250. This was great - it was exactly what I needed, something to kick my butt and keep my mind in line.</p>

<p>My indoor workouts, the hard ones certainly, even to this day tip toe on the fine line between passing out and maximum effort. Maybe I am a masochist but those hard workouts really bring out the best in me. The sheer feeling of time slowing down, heart pumping as if its going to burst out of my neck, legs screeming for me to stop became my version of heaven. Doing this for a few days and I could feel I was getting faster outdoors on my real bike too.</p>

<p>The rest of my body was becoming like a typical cyclist body. Thin and lean upper body but with strong and powerful legs. I didn't want to be a body builder but thought I should do something about the upper body too, to bring balance back. This is the time when I got myself a personal trainer to help me with the upper body workouts. So it was 2x PT sessions a week with 3x indoor training sessions, alternating with the strength sessions. The PT sessions were great because they were adding mass to my upper body and the indoor training was doing the same for the lower body. </p>

<p>Fast forward a few weeks, I noticed my trousers, the new ones didn't fit me well - I needed a belt to wear them. Hmm maybe its that time again? I fished out the tape measure, this time I was 32 inches. Time to go shopping again!</p>
