So in the last two days, I attended the future of webapps and I have to say, it was probably one of the most engaging conferences I have attended. It was so good that I think every frontend developer should attend it at least once.

The conference touched on various web related topics, the past, present and of course, the future. It highlighted various trends that we're all seeing but haven't been quite able to make anything of it. It answered most of the questions that I had but also left me with a couple of questions for myself to find and answer.
