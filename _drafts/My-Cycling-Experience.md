I bought my first cyclo-cross bike in UK about a month ago. The thing is, I didn't really plan to buy it. It was a spur of the moment type thing. I was at work and I had just finished my lunch. As I was getting settled at my desk, I noticed a brochure titled "Cycle to Work" on my colleague's desk. I had heard of this scheme before but never took real interest in it, mainly because I didn't really look into it that much. I had assumed that it was a 0% interest type thing but never knew about the tax benefits.

Just a week prior, I had heard that a couple of my work colleagues were going to do a coast to coast cycling challenge for charity. At that time, I wanted to join but couldn't because I didn't own a bike.

Now, armed with this new found knowledge about the tax benefits with a desire to get fit in order to be able to do a coast to coast challenge next year, I applied for the scheme.

Everything went through smoothly. In almost no time, I received the "Certificate of Collection". Basically, this is a piece of paper that I can use to collect a bike of up to the value on the certificate from participating bike shops.
