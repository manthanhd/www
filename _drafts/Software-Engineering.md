<p>Software Engineering holds a deep meaning for me. I think it has something to do with the fact that I've always wanted to become a Software Engineer since I was 8 years old. That's the age when I got my hands on my first computer. When I was writing those lines of code for a textual calculator in C++ I was like, "This is it. This is what I want to do". Of course things like unit, integration and performance testing didn't mean much to me at that time but still. Also, to be fair, I used to use the terms coder and Software Engineer quite interchangeably.<br/></p>

<p>As I progressed in my life, from one computer language to another, I found a much more deeper meaning to writing code. It wasn't just some random instruction to a piece of silicon. It was a way of distilling and refining an intent to solve a problem, passing it down from a chemical computer - the human brain into a electrical one. As years went by, that intent was no longer just to do something. It reached new levels, from just doing something, to do something and make sure it works in cases x, y and z. I think this is what has helped me distinguish between what it is to develop a solution and what it is to engineer one.</p>

<p>Engineering a solution involves a lot more refinement. It involves thinking, designing and implementing along side multiple perspectives in order to ensure the solution stands the test of time.</p>

<p>Here's a simple analogy to help expand on this. Think of the airplane. It is composed of a lot of things - seats, carpet, wheels, wings, engine etc. When you fly in one, which one of these things do you absolutely trust? Seats? Well if it breaks it'll make you a bit grumpy. Carpet? Most people don't even notice it. Wheels? Wings? Engine? Oh you bet. If one of the seats malfunctions or if the carpet is torn - its not a big deal, maybe a small news story. But if the wings of a flying aircraft fall apart mid air or even if there is a little smoke out of one of the jet engines, it'll make a lot more dent than just front page news.</p>

<p>For something that is used so many times in a day (<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/by_the_numbers/">5000 air crafts in sky at any given time</a>), building each and every component comes with a very big responsibility. Would you want to fly in an airplane that has not been tested because the manufacturer didn't have time? How comfortable would you be if the air hostess announced that they had skipped quality checks that evening because they were running late?</p>

<p>This is exactly what it means to engineer a solution.<br/></p>
