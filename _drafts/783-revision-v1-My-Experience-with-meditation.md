<p>I learned meditation a long time ago. That time was when 1 was the smallest and 10 was the largest number for me. My school at that time had a class called "Assembly" where we used to meditate. I can't remember how long but it was probably about 5-10 minutes. This stuck with me throughout my school life. As any naive student, I didn't see much value in meditation at that time. I do remember feeling refreshed after meditating as part of the class, I don't remember ever doing it on my own. I didn't think I needed it, I just did it because it was part of one of my classes.</p>

<p>Fast forward to a year post graduation. I'm promoted to a role of Senior Software Engineer working full time in financial services. I have company objectives which are great and on track. Unbeknownst to anyone I also have personal objectives regarding my career which are not going so well. To remedy those, I'm working on side projects. These are in full swing and are going relatively well. Commitments everywhere, no time to pause. Life has turned into a race where contrary to the perception from outside, I'm not doing so great.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why am I not doing great? Because my personal goals are 100x stricter than the company objectives. They're so challenging that the company objectives to me are a walk in the park. To achieve them I have to go through a significant bulk of side projects, in addition to being exceptionally successful at work. Time is short so to get more of it, I devise a schedule.</p>

<p>Now, this routine worked really well for more than a year. Sure there were gaps here and there, like the week I didn't cook at all and lived off of home delivered Dominos so that I get more time on the keyboard. Or the week when I was on "holiday" from work and basically treated the workdays as weekends and still stuck with the routine of working on side projects. Watching movies or TV shows was a waste of time. Someone advised me to "relax". Why should I spend a single second in doing something that does not contribute directly to my goals? Needless to say, I was headed for a crash. A big one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I sort of remember the day when it came. It was on a Friday and I was on the bus home. I was on the front right seat on the upper deck of bus route number 10. Suddenly, out of nowhere, as if someone had dropped a piano on my heart, I had a really strong urge to cry. Not like couple of tears, but more like a full on opening-the-flood-gates sort of crying. I held back the tears though. Don't want to cry in public. That is not what I do. Must hold back the tears until I get home. Luckily I soon arrived at my stop, and I got out. Without thanking the bus driver, I quickly walked home. When I reached, I let it all go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, in this moment, the weirdest thing was that although I had this overwhelming urge to cry my heart out, and I did, I kept trying to find what it was that was making me sad and cry. Was it someone at my office who said something? No. Was it someone on the bus? No. Was it someone who looked at me wrong? No. Well, what is the source of this overpowering sadness? I couldn't find it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a while, when my tear ducts were dry, the tears stopped, but the weight over my heart wasn't going anywhere. I didn't want to cook, didn't want to get out of my room because I didn't know when the flood gates will open next. This was the first time I broke my routine. Didn't work on my side projects, didn't cook, just sat in silence, trying to figure out what was going on. After a while my eyes got heavy and I embraced sleep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The thing is, no matter how your mind is feeling, the body seems to have its own agenda. I woke up at about 4 AM, hungry. That weight over my heart had lightened a bit but it was still there. Had it lightened or was I just getting used to it? I went through the morning routine, made and devoured my breakfast and sat on my desk. I was still trying to pin point the cause of all this. I turned the TV on but on the back ofÂ  my mind I was still trying to replay the events that had occurred, something which might be affecting me now. I kept going further and further back and couldn't find it. I didn't do any work that weekend, just sat in silence, half paying attention to the TV.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the following Monday. The weight is significantly lighter but is still there, reminding me of its presence. I could've called in sick but again, that is not what I do. Sick to me is not being able to walk. Something physical. Can I take sick leave if I'm just feeling sad? What would I say to my manager? I'm sad? Pfft! That sounds silly. I have to go to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was walking to work, subconsciously I started playing the audio book. Something in doing that didn't feel right. I stopped it, removed my headphones and continued walking. That felt better. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The work day was normal. I tried to act like I usually did, happy, making jokes here and there, lightening up the mood. I couldn't. I was mostly quiet. Someone asked if everything was alright. I pretended. Someone even confronted me one-on-one, I lied deflecting their attention to something that was completely bullshit, that I made up on the spot. They appeared to have gotten what they wanted. I was on my own again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going home felt good. My heart felt slightly heavier than it was when I went to work. No audio books this time either. Just plain walking, listening to the city sounds. Things eventually got better. Becoming more "normal". What the hell is "normal" anyway? The state where I'm supposed to pretend that I am happy and easy going? Maybe it is normal because that is what I usually do every day and people get used to it. Since they get used to it that is what they associate me with. And maybe when my behaviour doesn't fulfill their expectation, that's when someone asks "what's wrong?".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Something changed that day. When I was at work, I felt this strange feeling building up, weighing my heart when I was talking to people. Again, no reason, things were as usual. Going home and relaxing helped relieve it but it was back the next day. On one of these days, I was at work, preparing for a presentation. This feeling of having weight on my heart came back. No no no, this can't be happening now. I need to do this presentation. I sat on my desk, in silence. Eyes closed. Removing all thoughts from my head, hoping to relieve it. I started feeling better. I kept at it. After what must've been only about 10-15 minutes, I felt a lot better. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That day, as I was doing the presentation I couldn't help thinking - I was basically meditating at my desk and it helped me feel better. I think I have found a solution to this "problem". As soon as the day ended and I arrived home, I sat down on the floor in lotus posture, as my school had taught me to and meditated for solid 10 minutes. I felt a lot better. Over the evening I checked out a bunch of apps for meditation and eventually settled one and subscribed to their free mindfulness course. Over the week I did one session every day. Towards the end, I felt as if I had found the perfect solution against this "problem" of mine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over that month, I meditated more and more, eventually going from being able to do 10 minutes a day to doing 30 minutes a day. It wasn't particularly difficult to follow through as this was something I had done throughout my childhood. The difficult part was just committing that time every day. I missed a couple of days here and there but overall I had resolved my problem. Interacting with people at the office was back to "normal" again. I didn't feel any weight over my heart, things started getting back on track. Since I was feeling all better, I stopped meditating. That goal oriented, tail-on-the-fire me was back. Why waste 30 minutes sitting down and doing nothing when I can spend that precious time in doing my side projects. Or at work getting something done? Couple of months go by without meditation and I feel fine. Almost a year now. Normal. Nothing to worry about.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And BAM! Out of nowhere it hits me again. Grand Piano over the heart, flood gates open, sadness everywhere. I want to curl up in a ball and hide. It is so intense that I can't even think about fixing it. I am completely focused on how I feel. There's nothing to fix because these feelings are "me" and I am these feelings. Can a broken vase pickup its pieces and fix itself?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Slowly and steadily I get back up on the ramp. As I get out of it, I start thinking about solutions. Meditation! I start doing it again. Half an hour each day keeps that god damn grand piano away. Someone at work mentions "bike to work" scheme. I decide to buy a bike.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cycling seemed to calm my mind. Maybe not physically but it was mentally relaxing. I don't need to meditate anymore because an hour of cycling essentially fulfills my mental needs. Going over that one more hill gives me that sense of achievement that the goal oriented me loves whilst also relaxing me during the long stretches of road. <br></p>
