Most of the projects I work on are multi-module projects so updating versions of pom files manually is a bit pain. As always, here's a command you can run that will update all pom versions in one go:
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=2.0-SNAPSHOT</pre>
Make sure all your modules are discoverable. You can do this by enabling all your profiles in case some of your sub-modules are not visible from the main pom.
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true">mvn -P profile1,profile2 versions:set -DnewVersion=2.0-SNAPSHOT</pre>
