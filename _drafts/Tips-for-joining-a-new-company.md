<p>More than a month ago I left Capital One and joined Ripple. While the transition was a momentous ordeal for myself, I have a feeling that it wasn't exactly "that big a deal". You see, before this point in my life, I never made my own decision to pivot my career by such a significant degree. Sure I've made choices like shifting my focus from full stack to backend development, refining my skills in one technology over another and even working out what I needed to do finance-wise; but nothing to such grand proportions. I'll leave out the whole complex decision making process that I went through for another day, for this post, lets keep it to how I handled my first month at my new company. Here are my four biggest tips:</p>

<p><strong>To learn, you must first unlearn what you have learned.</strong> When you join a new organisation, it will not be exactly the same as the previous one. Well, if it was, what was the point of leaving the first one? As you make you way through your first couple of days, your subconscious will be on the edge of its seat, even conflicted in some cases. Subtle cues from people's behaviour that you'd have used in your previous company to phrase your sentences are now gone. Even worse, they have changed! You think you have everyone figured out, you don't. Because they are not the same people. People in an organisation shape the culture of the organisation as much as the organisation shapes them. It is vital to keep this in mind while you communicate with your peers, managers and senior leaders. During my time, this is what helped me cleanse my mind of negative thoughts as they planted themselves from the seed of doubt.</p>

<p>That was just from the behavioural perspective. If you've joined a technical role like I did, things were different too. I had to throw away my reservations and start from a blank slate. Now bear in mind, the reservations that you may have were generated based on good reason. Things like "don't do x because of y" or "avoid a because it will make b, c and d worse" have their place but the key thing here is context. Those reservations, assumptions and myths were produced within a different context than you are now. Things have changed so whatever situation made you distill the entire problem-solution scenario down to "don't do x because of y" is probably non-existent here, or worse, is completely different. Therefore, it is imperative to pause your previous learnings, just keep it on hold, don't need to scrub it out yet, so that you can absorb and process the new knowledge without resistance.</p>

<p><strong>Openness and humility go a long way together.</strong> OK you're in a new organisation. What is the most optimal route to success?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Absorb as much knowledge as possible. To understand the current situation.</li><li>Speak to as many people as possible. To get different perspectives.</li><li>Pick up varied, sizable chunks of work. To gain as much exposure as possible</li><li>Reflect upon self and get feedback. To gain perception and better understand the trajectory you're heading towards.</li></ul>

<p>The first two are the most important and also are the ones that people most misunderstand. Knowledge comes only to an open mind. <br/></p>

<p>Process, evaluate, repeat.</p>

<p>Don't forget to pat yourself on the back on a job well done.</p>
