Well, it is really very simple. Here you go:
<ol>
	<li>Download the file. You can get it from <a href="http://min.us/mXvNL53WB#1o" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Double click it. It should open as any other normal application.
<ol>
	<li>If it doesn't open as expected or opens WinRAR/WinZIP/7-Zip or any other archiving software, follow here:
<ol>
	<li>Right click the file and point to Open With.</li>
	<li>Click on Select Default Program.</li>
	<li>Java should be here in the list of programs. If it isn't then click browse and locate your java installation. It should be in C:Program FilesJavajre7binjava.exe
<ol>
	<li>If you dont have any folder called Java in Program files, then go to www.java.com and download and install it first.</li>
	<li>Once Java is installed, follow step 2.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Click OK. Follow step 2.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Click on 'Add File' button to add files to it. A dialog box will be presented.</li>
	<li>Locate your source code files. You can select more than one file by selecting one file and then holding the 'Ctrl' key and selecting other files. Alternatively, if you wish to select all files, you can press 'Ctrl + A' to select all files in the directory you are in.
<ol>
	<li>Make sure that you do not select any executable files. This may cause an error.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Click OK/Open.</li>
	<li>You should see list of files in the list above 'Add File' button. If you wish to add more files, follow step 3.</li>
	<li>Once you are done, click Start. It will start counting lines in the files you have selected.</li>
	<li>You're done! The table will display number of code lines in each file and below the table you'll find total line count and line density.</li>
</ol>
