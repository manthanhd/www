So I found this error when I started Lotus Notes this morning. After looking through some forums, I found that I needed to re-install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 (Redistributable) from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555" target="_blank">here</a>.

This error is usually caused by C:\Windows\System32\MSVCR100.dll being corrupted. Reinstalling VC++ Â fixes it.
