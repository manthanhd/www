I have been working on this for a while and now I have finally released it. This is 0.1 beta so it may contain bugs. However, I am working on it constantly and am trying to improve the API.<br /><br />Job Execution API is all about job execution in Java. You have jobs which comprise of tasks. Each task is a class implementing the ITask interface. For now, the task is not Async so tasks are executed sequentially, in linear pattern. I intend to provide basic tasks which you can use to create standard jobs. You can later extend these tasks and make your own.<br /><br />Download the API here and let me know how it goes:<br /><a href="https://www.box.com/s/6cnn93gkrjmuf39sp12d">https://www.box.com/s/6cnn93gkrjmuf39sp12d</a>
