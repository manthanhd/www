  <h1>Finding a file contained within a bunch of tar files without opening any</h1>

  <p>So I was debugging some code the other day and I quickly found myself in a situation where I had to look for a class file that was located in one of the many millions of jar files that are there in my maven cache. My immediate reaction was</p>
<blockquote>"Ugh, this is going to be loads of effort and is going to take ages!".</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, quick one minute google found the following command:<!--more--></p>

<p><code>find <strong>/home/manthan/.m2</strong> -name '<strong>*.jar</strong>' -type f|while read f; do p="$(tar tf $f|egrep <strong>awesome</strong>)"; [ -n "$p" ] &amp;&amp; echo -e "$f\n$p" ; p=""; done</code></p>

<p>Where <code>awesome.class</code> is the file I’m looking for in all files (indicated with <code>-type f</code> option) with extension <code>jar </code>found in <code>/home/manthan/.m2</code> directory.</p>
